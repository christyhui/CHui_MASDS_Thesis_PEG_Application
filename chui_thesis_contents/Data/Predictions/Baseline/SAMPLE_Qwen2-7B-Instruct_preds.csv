Introduction

Carrying out a risk assessment presupposes addressing every single factor that may affect a project in any possible way; in other words, economic, political, financial, cultural, and social issues need to be taken into account so that the members of the project could feel secure. Drilling for oil, which is the subject of Moylanâs article, showcases the complexity of risk assessment, as it is one of the projects that are fraught with numerous risks. Particularly, the risk of failing to obtain the required amount of oil to cover the expenses taken deserves to be mentioned; however, the specified threat also entails other risks, such as the threat of significant damage to peopleâs health and the environment in the light of the fact that âonly a fraction of the 100 billion total would be recoveredâ (Moylan par. 2).

Main Body

First and most obvious, the members of the organization as the key stakeholders deserve to be mentioned. In case the project turns out to be a failure and the environmental hazard is unleashed, the company will suffer significant financial losses for covering the damage and compensating the people involved (Hunter 37).

Additionally, the government authorities should be mentioned as the stakeholders in the specified case. According to Brouthers and Bamossy, governmental institutions are affected significantly in the instances of international significance: âstrategic choice that firms [SOEs] make is inherently affected by the formal and informal constraints of the institutional frameworkâ (Brouthers and Bamossy 286). The subject matter, in its turn, can be related to the problems of an international scale, seeing that the process of oil retrieval may pose a threat of a global scale due to the fractures in the crust and, therefore, the threat of an oil spill (Moylan par. 20).

Finally, the entire community can be viewed as stakeholders in the light of the fact that damage to the environment, particularly, to the soil and, possibly, the groundwater (in case of an oil spill) will affect the evolution of species and cause the contamination of groundwater. Although drilling will occur in an area that is not currently inhabited by people, it still contains the land resources that may be affected to a huge degree if an accident occurs (Suslick and Schiozer 3).

The risks, therefore, vary from environmental (groundwater contamination) and health-related increase in disease rates and possible epidemics caused by polluted water) to societal (the stress caused by the possible relocation, peopleâs fear for their health and even life) and economic (significant drop in the amount of workforce due to the effects that drilling may have on the local population) and political (the stateâs refusal to support the companyâs further operations due to the problems that oil drilling may cause) (Tainter and Patzek 87).

The risks listed above can be defined as external and relate to the company, particularly, the threat of a financial loss that the organization may take if its leaders decide to pursue the goal of drilling for oil in the designated area. However, apart from the organization, other stakeholders may suffer. As it has been stressed above, people living in the vicinity may face health and environmental risks, as well as economical and societal ones related to their possible relocation. Local entrepreneurship, particularly, SMEs, which depend on the local workforce, as well as the local customers, will also be affected in case pollution makes people move; therefore, a significant drop in the economic stability of the region can be expected if the process of drilling for oil gets out of hand (Lerche viii).

Conclusion

Every entrepreneurship or project involves a certain amount of risks; however, when these risks affect the community and concern not only economic but also environmental issues, the adequacy of further encouragement of the companyâs actions should be doubted. Therefore, drilling for oil in the designated area should be postponed until further identification of all avenues available for managing the risks listed above and preventing a possible environmental, economic, and social catastrophe. Therefore, it is highly recommended that UCOG should reconsider its current risk management strategy and reinforce it.

I do not like the idea of not being able to play sports without a B average. A lot of kids in our school have a C average. That would shorten the sports teams a lot and risk our chances of winning. Also, if kids aren't active it could cause health issues. Kids and teens now a days are not getting enough exercise.

Sports are what gives them the most of it. By taking away sports from people with anything lower than a B average, could be harming kids. If they don't have things to do out of school, studies show that they will turn to bad habits, like drugs or gangs. Another point, some kids have learning disabilities, and that could disable them from getting A or B averages, and they could be trying there hardest. Taking away sports from them could make them feel bad about themselves, and feel like they aren't good enough. Social reasons is another reasons sports shouldn't be taken away. A lot of friendships are formed on sports teams. Having friends is important in school. If one friend can play and the other can't, there friendship could go away because they don't have things in common anymore. Overall, sports are an important part of a kids life. Taking them away for having lower that a B average would be a bad idea. Please take what I'm saying to note. Thank you.

Introduction

Restraint of trade is a clause that is included in contracts to bar the employees from taking clients, information, or competing with the original business when the employment contract is completed. It is important to note that restraint of trade clauses need to be clear and reasonable for them to be enforceable (OâSulluian & Hilliard, 2012). Restraint of trade is most likely to be used in cases where the employer has legitimate property for example property rights to protect. In addition, there should be satisfactory reasons to believe that employees can use the same to their gain or the benefit of a competitor. In this case, the employer can institute the restraint of trade on employees. Another scenario is between suppliers and customers. Suppliers can use the restraint of trade clause to restrict their customers from using the information they gain during their business to benefit themselves or other third parties (Chitty, 2012).

Example of Restraint of Trade in Employment Contract

It is important to note that in most cases, restraint of trade clauses are applied by employers on employees. A typical restraint of trade clause on an employment contract will be: The employee agrees that he or she shall not, after the termination of the employment contract with the employer, either directly or indirectly, acting alone, with others or as an agent, for 18 months and within the estate where the employer has his business:

 1. Be involved in the manufacture or distribution of alcoholic drinks or
 2. Finance or guarantee the obligations of such activity

For the above restraint to be enforceable it should meet the conditions for restrain of trade clauses. As was held by the court in the case of CLAAS Medical Center Pte Ltd v Ng Ching (2010), all restraint of trade clauses is void unless they are meant for the interest of the public. Additionally, there should be a legal proprietary interest to protect. On the same note, any restraint of trade clause should have a time limit, the scope of activities as well as a definite geographical area where it applies. In the case of Heller Factoring (Singapore) Ltd v Ng Tong Yang (1998), the court held that the duration of two years was reasonable. Consequently, since the above clause gives a definite time of 18 months, geographical area as well as the specific activity it will be enforceable (Tabulujan & Toit-Low, 2009).

Rights and Obligations of the University and Speedy Coach in Case of Monsoon Rains

The contract between the University and speedy coach is binding on both parties given the fact that both parties agreed on the reason for the contract and the contract was sealed by a price. In this regard, the university is obliged to pay speedy coach the remaining amount when the contract is executed. However, due to natural conditions which are beyond the control of the speedy coach they are unable to execute the contract. It is important to note that in law, impossibility excuses for one not perform his or her part of the bargain. It is the right of the university to demand that speedy coach performs their duty as agreed in the contract. In law, extreme conditions which are referred to as acts of God can exempt both parties from the performance of the contract. As was held in the case of Hackney Borough Council v Dore (1922), in instances of physical or material restraint either party can be exempted from performance (Lundmark, 1998). It should however be noted that the force majeure has limitations on how it can be applied. In the case of Matsoukas v Priestman & Co. (1915), issues like bad weather, football matches, or a funeral are not included in the explanation of force majeure. However, in the case of speedy coach mudslides can be considered an act of God. In the case of re Dharnrajmal Gobindram v Shamji Kalidas (1961), the court held that consequences beyond a pertâs control can be used as an excuse for non-performance. In this regard, the university can reschedule the trip to another day or seek a refund from a court of law.

Rights and Obligations of the University and Speedy Coach in Case of Exhibition Postponement

In the second case, the university entered into a contract with a speedy coach to be transported to Cameron hills but this has changed. Under these circumstances, it is the university that changed the conditions of the contract. The fact that the exhibition was postponed is not a legal excuse because that was not specified in the contract. Therefore, the contract is frustrating since the destination has changed. As was held in the case of Nicholls and Knight v Ashton, Eldridge & Co (1901), specifying the name of the ship frustrated the contract. In the case of the university and speedy coach, the reasons for the journey have changed and it will be useless to go there (Tan, 1999).

This is a case of contract discharge where performance is unreasonable. Truly, it will be a waste of time and resources to go on a futile journey to the mountains. Unlike the case of Herne Bay Steamboat Co v Hutton (1903) where the contract included a cruise around the fleet, the university booked the coach for the sole purpose of the exhibition. In the above case, it was held that the appellant should be paid. In the case of Kerry v Henry (1903), the court of appeal held that there was an implied condition that never came into being and thus the contract was void. The defendant was therefore not obliged to pay the remaining money (Fisher S. & Fisher D., 1998). The university is obliged to report to speed coach the reasons why the contract would not be carried out as planned. Consequently, the university and speed coach company would then agree on what percentage of the deposit will be returned. However, this will depend on the interpretation of the implied conditions.

Rights and Obligations of Sonata Gallery and Red Stars Gallery

According to the law of agency, the principal is bound by all actions of the agent provided they are within the conditions of the contract. The conditions are well stipulated in the case of Freeman and Lockyer v Buckhurst Park Properties (Mangal) Ltd (1964). It is important to note that once an agent has agreed to work for the principal, he or she is bound to undertake the tasks as outlined by the terms of the agency (Campell, 2008). The duties should be carried out with care and diligence while avoiding conflict of interest. Consequently, the agent is supposed to carry out the duties that benefit the principal and not any other party at the peril of the principal.

However, there are instances where an agent cannot wait for the authorization of his or her activities. In such instances, the principal may ratify the actions after they have occurred. Therefore Sonata Gallery has the legal authority to ratify Markâs actions. To begin with, Mark acted on the pretext that he was representing Sonata Gallery (Tuunanen, 2011). As was held in the case of Keighly v Durand, L. R. (1900), a principal is allowed to ratify any action of the agent if the act was carried out in the name of the principal. It is important to note that ratification will make the transaction look like it was originally done by the principal and all benefits therein should revert to the principal. Therefore, after ratification Sonata Gallery can demand the proceeding of the sale. In the case of Keppel v Wheller (1927), the court held that the agents were liable to pay damages to the owners because of a breach of their implied duty. In this regard, Mark should give back all the profits from the sale (Phang & Yihan, 2012). This is also explained in the case of Lucifero v Castel (1887) as well as Boardman v Phipps (1967). Sonata Gallery should ratify the actions of mark quickly before Red Stars decides to decline the ratification.

Red Stars was not aware and were in no position to know that Mark did not have authority from Sonata Gallery. In addition, having confirmed before that Mark was acting on behalf of Sonata Gallery it was just reasonable for Red Stars to assume that he always had authority. Therefore, Red Stars can communicate to Sonata Gallery about its intention not to be bound by the ratification. However, this should be done before ratification (Phang, Chan & Chiu, 2012). On the same note, Red Stars can sue Mark for deceit as well as breach of the implied warranty of authority and demand damages on the same.

9,"âCapturingâ in Culture and Beyond Essay

In a laymanâs language, the term technology is an assortment of techniques. In fact, as a concept, technology itself is extremely wide and ambiguous. Robert Friedel provides his definition of the term in a well-ordered, instructive, and easily understandable manner in his book A Culture of Improvement where he expresses his own opinion.

In this book, Freidel introduces the concept of âcapturingâ in technology, which seeks to elaborate the series of changes involved in the process of technological improvements. He tries to figure out the reasons as to why technology keeps on altering every day activities.

He shows the extent to which technology can undergo transformation, as well as the possible results of the technological alterations. While the dynamic changes occur, the positive impact felt based on a variety of enhancements affects the surrounding (Friedel 98). This paper aims at underpinning Freidelâs claim that there existed a âculture of improvementâ in western technology by providing examples of such technological improvements. Further, it shows how the improvements are âcapturedâ.

Friedelâs book majorly focuses on two key theses. In the first one, he ascertains that, over the past 1000 years, a âculture of improvementâ that focuses entirely on technological improvement and the ways in which it can be sustained has been developed in the west. The second thesis is mostly concerned about the rate at which technological change has changed in the past 500 years following the new and more effective methods of making technological improvement a part of the sustained change series.

In support of Friedelâs first thesis, there are numerous proofs of the existence of the âcaptureâ of technological improvements that have existed in the western world. The focus on improvement that Freidel takes is important since it explains both the contingent and the contextual character embraced by technological changes, as well as providing an elaborate explanation as to why some of these technological changes catch on while others fail miserably.

The technological advancements that shape the world today link well with the technological innovations that took place in Europe during the middle ages (Stahl 189). For instance, the medieval Venetian mint produced ten million coins a year, which were in use for a long period even after many years had passed.

This was one of the biggest production facilities in the west whose effect in technological advancement was felt even centuries later. In the course of the thirteenth century to the fifteenth century, Venetian mint adapted many technological innovations, as well as production control systems, a move that enabled it to maintain a competitive edge over its close rivals.

These innovations also assisted in thwarting the malicious acts of counterfeiters, clippers, and cullers who could lower the productsâ utility (Stahl 191). The existence of the constant technological improvements in Europe as early as the thirteenth century validates Friedelâs thesis on the existence of âa culture of improvementâ in the western technology.

The invention of more sophisticated weapons was responsible for warfare in the west for many years, as nations wanted to expand by conquering others and making them subject to their will. For instance, one can understand the tension that existed between the science of military and the protocols involved in the renaissance siege through considering the 1555 plan to bombard the city of Siena during the last days of the Italian wars. The plot involved the use of big guns to destroy the walls of Siena (Pepper 573).

Technological innovations, as posited in Freidelâs book, ensured that such cities as Siena constructed protective mechanisms such as walls while, on the other hand, the enemies continuously invented powerful weapons that could destroy such protective walls. This process of technological betterment or improvement constitutes what Freidel terms as the âculture of improvementâ, that ensured the coming up of better weapons, as well as protective barriers in the west.

As described by Jonathan Israel, Netherlands, the genius of the seventeenth century did not rely on the artworks of the time but rather on the civic pride and the technological improvements that spread to the rest of Europe. The rapid growth of the Dutch cities between the years 1648 and 1720 is attributable to the technological innovations and improvements that were taking place at the time (Israel 85).

This led to the growth of the cities to the extent that most of the Dutch people felt strongly endowed to them. In most cases, they identified themselves with the cities rather than the country. It is arguable that since the West has managed to advance its technological development over a certain time of its history, its antiquity was to be drafted prior to other regions with the purpose of avoiding other histories to be written first.

In his book, Friedel quoted his most significant hypothesis. He concluded that, over the past thousand centuries, there appeared a culture of improvement in the West that made western people accept the idea that hi-tech modernization is advantageous to people.

The comprehensive communal image was what Friedel meant by the term âculture of improvementâ. Friedel sticks to the point that improvement, as he actually uses the term, cannot compare with the term development. The last one holds an ethical intelligence that may be vague from the previous knowledge of the massacre: it can be enhanced but can never be viewed as an improvement.

While focusing on the improvement, more so the ordinary arrangement of improvement that perceives persons and cultures endeavoring to style changes, Friedel demonstrates this by comparing it to human evolution. He used the word âcaptureâ to validate the methods that proved the fact that technological developments were not only documented but also âentertainedâ, for instance, by facilitating and promoting them to the broader world.

As Friedel states, the capacity to gain control over âcaptureâ can be closely associated with having authority in any society. He had a feeling that those who could influence âcaptureâ were to be placed in a better position of reaping greater benefits than the main founders did. He said that such persons would be seen to invent new and modern technologies.

The concept of âcaptureâ, as brought forth by Friedel, explains the series of changes that have taken place for a period of over 1000 years in the western world. Freidel goes ahead to post that there was a âculture of improvementâ existing in the western technology for a very long period.

Ranging from the technological innovations to the militarism, there is a substantial and reliable evidence for the claim that Freidel makes in his book. Concisely, arguments about technological change, as presented forth by Friedel, remain a long-term debate. Otherwise, he deserves a thumb for his keen and close observation of technological transformations with time.

This paper aims at underpinning Freidelâs claim that there existed a âculture of improvementâ in western technology by providing examples of such technological improvements. Further, it shows how the improvements are âcapturedâ.

An advisory is a consulting center or a firm assisting both individuals and organizations in the corresponding areas. For example, EY advisory services offer industry-focused solutions to drive business performance (âBig 4 Accounting Firms â Who They Are, Facts and Informationâ par. 4). Particularly, the range of services provided by the advisory is wide and might include the assistance to determine the development strategy, to establish prospective goals of the company, or to implement the project.

The quality of the operation and the positive image of the organization as well as the global coverage are key incentives that motivate me to join the Big 4s. The experience of the organization comprises a plethora of successfully implemented projects and goals. Speaking of the EY MENA that also has a spotless reputation as a leader in the field of advisory, it is necessary to pinpoint the excellent career opportunities proposed by the organization (âAdvisory Servicesâ par.1). Additionally, the fact that EY MENA performs the most significant projects in a team including the best professionals stimulates me to join it. I would like to be a part of something important and develop my professional knowledge and skills.

The market is increasingly driven by oil prices. If the oil is rising, then stocks are also rising and vice versa. In this situation, the banking sector suffers significantly (âCrude Awakening: The Impact of Plummeting Crude Oil Prices on Company Financesâ par. 2). It is not surprising as the oil sector is strongly credited. Low commodity prices hit the effectiveness of oil producers and increase the risk of defaults on loans. All this increases the costs of banks in the form of debtsâ write-offs reducing their profitability and, as a result, the attractiveness of the securities.

What aspect(s) of corporate social responsibilities are demonstrated in the article?

The article entitled âReplacing the âdumbest idea in the wordâ by Skapinker â (2010) is about the oft-repeated issue of corporate social responsibility (CSR). The article seems to seek the meaning of CSR which issue has been settled before long. It records the divergent perceptions by the CEOs of some of the worldâs leading corporates such as Citigroup, Uniliver, etc. The article highlights the never-ending conflict between shareholder interests and CSR interests, the CEOs are often faced with. Citigroupâs CEO has no words to express except sorry.

Does he mean to convey that his company failed to protect shareholdersâ interests by serving the customerâs/consumerâs interests? Lambert of British Employersâ group has said that shareholder value which General Electricâs former CEO had held on to has at last been given up by him as evidenced by his recent observation that shareholder value is the âdumbest ideaâ in the world conceding that shareholder value is a result and not a strategy.

Paul Polman of Uniliver is of the same view in that it is the customer or consumer that his company should serve which alone would ensure positive business results. It may be the tendency of shareholders to maximize their profits in the short term and to keep shedding their shares. But managers cannot afford to serve the shareholdersâ self-serving interests as they are driven by CSR tenets which are what Chapter 5 is all about. The central theme of the chapter is that CSR aims to serve the interests of the stakeholders in a corporate set up such as shareholders, suppliers, employees, consumers, customers, environment, financiers, government agencies, etc.

The managers need not feel guilty if shareholdersâ selfish interests of maximizing profits at the cost of the other stakeholders are not served, for two reasons. First, it will be suicidal for the shareholders since their company will not survive in the long run if all the stakeholdersâ interests are not taken care of. Second, after all, the shareholdersâ liability is limited and they are not assuming the entire risks of the business as in the event of loss, the stakeholders will suffer more than the shareholders do.

What is the ethical consequence(s) of what is reported in the article?

Stefan (2010) in his farewell article âBefore the curtain falls, three final wordsâ stresses the importance of the human side of management. The final three words are âsee it humanâ, writing on the wall for the managers to be aware of their ethical responsibility to consider the human aspect behind their every action/decision. As an ethical consequence, the author recalls the British businessmanâs selling of engine parts to the U.S. Air force by seeing the business opportunity in a War.

Be it the sweat labor in Chinaâs factory which assembles beautiful parts of Appleâs iPad, the global warming consequences the World is facing or managing people, todayâs managers have the enormous responsibility to see the human suffering behind every one of them. These are all fraught with ethical consequences which chapter 3 tries to impress upon. The situations explained in the article involve decision making without due regard to ethical consequences.

Seizing a wartime business opportunity, engaging sweat labor for profit maximization and indiscriminate exploitation of natural resources and spoiling the environment leading to global warming detrimental to mankindâs future survival, call attention to the ethical responsibilities of todayâs managers. Chapter 3 lays down the ethical principles to be observed in business conduct. The utilitarian principle of the eighteenth century is relevant even in the present 21 st century. The principle enjoins that man should consider the consequences of his actions. Hence a consequentialist approach is necessary behind managerial decisions.

The consequences of the above-cited examples in the article stare at the faces of managers who in their greed to maximize profits and their executive remuneration failed to realize human suffering. Wartime opportunities may have been instrumental in killing the British citizens themselves. Not that the citizens of other countries killed were not humans. Similarly, young people who committed suicide at the Chinese plant where Appleâs iPad were assembled due to appalling work conditions or whatever is another example (consequence) of unethical decision making without the least regard to the utilitarianism principle.

19,"American vs. Chinese Society Coursework

The primary difference between American and Chinese societies is attitude toward work. Americans are known to the world for the individualism and emphasis on personal achievement. Chinese, on the contrary, value teamwork and are focused on result rather than contribution of each member. Therefore, it is possible to hypothesize that American society is individual-based while Chinese community is more cooperative. Cultural differences between American and Chinese societies are significant. American people seek balance in their life trying to devote enough time to work, family, and recreation. A stranger to Chinese culture may think that Chinese people are focused on work only. Finally, American people value personal space and are willing to protect their opinion while Chinese are not concerned about personal distance and are more likely to compromise.

It is impossible to state whether American society is better than Chinese. However, the fact is that Chinese economy is rapidly developing and Chinese have already proved the whole world that they are able to become economic leaders. The current financial crisis affected both countries, but Chinese are more likely to survive it with minimal damage due to emphasis on teamwork and culturally-defined willingness to compromise.

I strongly believe that English language should be used in global business. English is learnt and spoken throughout the world. It is possible to meet an English-speaking person in any part of the globe. Most of the business documents are prepared in English language. Business conferences and international meetings are held in English language. There is no doubt that English is the most suitable language for business. Compared to Chinese, English language is much easier to learn. Finally, English language has already become a language of international business.

American society is characterized with success-driven culture. American people are hard-working and are rewarded for their personal achievements and contributions both in personal and professional life. For example, every person has equal opportunity to be promoted to upper management positions based on his professional qualities and experience only. There is no discrimination in American society and rights of all citizens are equality protected. Japanese culture also emphases the importance of hard and personal contribution; however, Japanese society is less culturally and ethnically diverse than America. Japanese people are known to the world for their strict hierarchy based on age and social position. The value of respect is of primary importance.

I think that Japanese society is more traditional than American one. In other words, the respect for elderly and social hierarchy are not common in American culture where rights of people are not attributed with consideration of age. Thus, there is evident disrespect of older people in American community. In terms of business culture, Japan and United States represent two opposite worlds. Both economies are developed and technically innovative; however, business communication practices are rather different. In particular, Japan will seek consensus on all contract points while Americans will strive to push forward their opinion.

Finally, I do believe that English is the only language that has a potential to become a global language of business. Companies working on international business market have no opportunity to sign contracts in different languages for two reasons:

 1. upper managers responsible for company-wide decisions are mostly English-speaking;
 2. there should be one language used in all documents.",Human,0,"American vs. Chinese Society Coursework

22,"Thalassemia: Epidemiology, Risk Factors, and Public Health Programs Report

Introduction

Thalassemia is a genetic disorder of the blood (autosomal recessive disorder) that leads to the abnormal formation of haemoglobin. The condition creates an imbalance between the oxygen and haemoglobin in the patientâs body. Patients diagnosed with the thalassemia disease cannot produce enough haemoglobin; hence, they can suffer from severe anaemia. The organs of such a patient are deprived of oxygen. Consequently, they cannot function effectively. The disorder is referred to as âautosomal recessiveâ since parents with major and minor Thalassemia coupled together with the beta Thalassemia genes have either a higher chance of about 25-percent of bearing children having Thalassemia major or 50-percent likelihood of getting a child with Thalassemia minor. The probability of bearing a child without thalassemia stands at 25-percent. This essay provides a critical analysis of the epidemiology of Thalassemia, risk factors, and public health programmes addressing the issue to both the internal and local health agencies in the United Arab Emirates (UAE).

Purpose of the Essay

The purpose of this essay is to analyse the epidemiology of Thalassemia, risk factors, and public health programmes addressing the issue to both the internal and local health agencies in the UAE. Immigration due to jobs and cross-border intermarriages is rampant in the UAE population. This situation has significantly contributed to blood disorders such as Thalassemia. About one in every 12 persons is currently a carrier of the disorder. The prevalence of the malady is currently a national concern. Its prevalence is highest in the UAE as compared to other countries worldwide. The disease is predominant among the adolescents in the UAE. This situation is likely to pose an adverse effect on the social and economic aspects of the UAE community (Vichinsky, 2005). Individuals within the age bracket constitute about 16-percent of the total population. Various researchers have noted an amplified pervasiveness of the mutant alleles responsible for the development of the alpha and beta-Thalassemia disorders in the UAE due to admixture.

The UAE community also practices consanguinity marriages whereby individuals of the same blood (relatives) join in matrimony. This situation is a predisposing factor to the thalassemia disorders. However, the lack of clear reports on the frequencies of the disorders in the UAE significantly affects its maintenance patterns. This set of circumstances increases the risk of bearing a homozygous and heterozygous offspring. Eventually, there can be a higher financial burden to both the individuals and government (Vichinsky, 2005). Furthermore, there is limited information regarding the prevalence of the malady despite the fact that its analysis is mostly based on quantitative studies. This situation results from the small-scale studies that are conducted without clear national information concerning the disorder (Vichinsky, 2005).

Statistical Results and Information about Thalassemia in the United Arab Emirates

Epidemiology of Thalassemia in the UAE

Two types of the disease namely Alpha and Beta Thalassemia exist. The body needs to have both the alpha and beta-globin to manufacture haemoglobin. The Beta Thalassemia occurs when one or both of the required genes for the formation of the beta-globin are non-existent or function ineffectively. When one of the genes is damaged, the individual can suffer from a minor Thalassemia. This condition can occur when a person acquires a normal gene from one parent and a Thalassemia gene from the other. The condition is revealed through signs and symptoms that include loss of appetite, whitish skin, irritation, and retarded growth among others. This symptoms appear in the first two years of infection.

Alpha Thalassemia is a condition that develops in case the patient lacks or has deformed alpha-globin components. This situation leads to a reduction in the size of the red blood cells. Patients experiencing such health conditions do not show any symptoms. As a result, they cannot be treated; hence, they are regarded as carriers. If the two genes are missing or damaged, a mild anaemia that requires treatment occurs. This situation is identified as the alpha Thalassemia trait. When the three genes are missing, the haemoglobin H disease occurs. This condition raises a need for a blood transfusion. In case the four genetic components are absent, the patient develops alpha Thalassemia major. The disease can be treated through a routine administration of blood transfusion alongside other therapies.

Although Thalassemia is infrequent in countries such as the United States, it is often noted in some Asian countries and the Mediterranean regions among others. Recent statistics indicate that about 350,000 births per year come with serious blood conditions that are related to the Thalassemia disorder. An increase of the disorder is exhibited in the United Arab Emirates due to the prevailing immigration patterns among other factors. This disease is also common in regions where there is a higher rate of P. falciparum malarial infections. However, the Alpha Thalassemia is more frequent in the Southern China, Malaysia, and Southeast Asia. The Beta Thalassemia is mostly noted in the Mediterranean regions, Southeast Asia, and Africa (Taher et al., 2010).

A report released by the third and fourth Annual Meetings of the WHO Working Group for the Community Control of Hereditary Anaemia indicated that haemoglobinopathies and Thalassemia are the most prevalent single gene disorders among the UAE population with an increasing frequency of 9.9/1000 births. The leading contributing factors as indicated in the report are both admixture and immigration. Various studies on the disease indicate that the beta-Thalassemia is more prevalent in the Mediterranean countries, the Middle East, Central Asia, Southern China, and India among other countries in Africa and South America. Highest percentages of carriers have been noted in Cyprus (14%), Sardinia (10.3%), and in South Asia. This situation has resulted from the fact that the regions are prone to the Plasmodium falciparum malaria. An estimation of 1 in about 100,000 worldwide is noted to have the disease at birth. A report released by the Thalassemia International Federation (TIF) indicated that about 200,000 individuals are registered patients who are given routine treatment (Vichinsky, 2005).

In the UAE, marriages that are based on consanguinity and immigration are the main contributors to the disorder. It is estimated that about 1 out of 12 people is a carrier of the disorder in the country. Past researches have also indicated about 16.7 percent and 1.7 percent adults in the UAE suffer from the Alpha and Beta Thalassemia respectively (Baysal, 2011). Symptoms of anaemia, G6PD deficiency, sickle cell traits, and beta-Thalassemia are more prominent among the children with pre-school children mostly affected (Baysal, 2011). It is further noted that the prevalence of the disease in this age category in the UAE is highest worldwide (Baysal, 2011).

Risk Factors of Thalassemia in the UAE

Economically, the UAE oil and tourism industries have increased the national revenue significantly. The country is ranked as one of the top twenty world economies in relation to the gross national income per capita. Due to the increased economic development and technology in the region, it has been experiencing an increased immigration of workers in the region. According to the 2005 national statistics, the population stood at about 20.1 percent with the rest coming from immigrants (Colah, Gorakshakar, & Nadkarni, 2010). A change in the lifestyle, environment, and social inclination in the region has increased likelihood of the risk factors to result in the Thalassemia disorder. There are increased social risk factors such as genetic-related predisposition due to marriages within families and influx of immigrants with various health threats such as smoking among others. It has been noted that the consanguineous intermarriages occur due to the culture and religious background that allow the action as one of the social practices valued in the UAE (Colah et al., 2010).

Public Health Programmes addressing the Issue to both the Internal and Local Public Health Agencies in the U.A.E

The healthcare standards in Dubai offer high quality services due to the increased government spending on the sector. The total state expenditure in the UAE was approximately US $436 million between 1996 and 2003. A report released by the World Health Organisation in 2004 indicated that the total expenditure of about 2.9% of the Gross Domestic Product. Furthermore, the World Bank has also indicated that the Dubai and Abu Dhabi Cities are the most prominent in the Middle East with highest medical tourism medication (Matar et al., 2011).

In 2009, the government discovered about 119 genetic disorders among the Emiratis. This figure represented the highest cases of genetic disorders in the region. The autosomal recessive ailments are common amongst haemoglobinopathies. The beta Thalassemia disorder is has also raised a major concern among many policymakers and health practitionerâs in the region. The prevalence of the disease stands at a frequency of 8.5 percent. It is indicated that 1 out of every 12 persons is a Thalassemia carrier. About 10,000 people had been taken for premarital tests in the Genetic and Thalassemia Centre by 2005 (Baysal, 2011). This situation led to a tremendous increase in the health sectors with over 40 public hospitals opening in the seven emirates. These centres include hospitals, medical, and trauma centres. In 2007, a state-of-the-art general hospital was launched in Abu Dhabi. The facility has a bed capacity of 143 patients, a trauma unit, and home-based healthcare programmes. The Dubai health care city is categorised as a hospital free zone that offers international advance standards for private healthcare and academic medical training (Baysal, 2011).

Premarital Screening

In 2006, the UAE government made a number of mandatory premarital tests for legal marriages to ensure that the country is protected from having children suffering from the genetically acquired diseases such as Thalassemia. The screening programme is part of preventive campaign that is developed in the country against Thalassemia (Matar et al., 2011). A prenatal diagnosis is also done to ensure that the genetic makeup of the foetus is detected and diagnosed for any carrier characteristics. The government used a principle of a 25-percent chance of getting a child with Thalassemia by a carrier parent or 50% likelihood of getting an uninfected child to identify 28 positive individuals in over 115 cases at the Genetic Centre in the country. The diagnosis came with various benefits of early detection and management, as people were relieved from the financial constraints that arose from bearing an infected child (Matar et al., 2011). Information on issues related to blood transfusion can also be clarified by ensuring an earlier diagnosis of a foetus. Such practices have been accomplished through the well-established DNA laboratory centre that works together with the high-tech cytogenetic test and analysis laboratory stations in the UAE to further clarify the metabolic conditions (Matar et al., 2011).

Although such programmes have been put in place, the government lays more emphasis on the premarital screening instead of the prenatal tests as a strategy for the prevention and control of the Thalassemia disorder. A mandatory screening before marriage is preferred to ensure that the issues of pregnancy termination that are against the religious beliefs of the society are alleviated (Matar et al., 2011).

New-Born Screening as a National Initiative Programme in the Country

Screening for the Thalassemia disorder is performed through high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) tests to determine the presence of abnormal haemoglobin in the body after birth. In most cases, the babies normally have higher foetal haemoglobin Hg F with Hgb S and no adult haemoglobin. A confirmatory test is always performed after 90 days in cases where the parents had a blood transfusion. Furthermore, the government also provides genetic counselling programmes to the parents and other patients concerning the conditions to reduce the development of stress. The counselling also has a purpose to protect future pregnancies since the mothers are trained in what to do in such cases. This situation can help in the prevention of terminating pregnancies (Matar et al., 2011).

Blood Donation Initiative and other Campaign Programmes

The government of the UAE in conjunction with the Al Naboodah National Contracting Group LLC has been in the forefront to encourage blood donation. These donations are conducted in the universities, shopping malls, and hospitals among other designated areas. The initiative is conducted to ensure that the anaemic patients are supplied with adequate amounts of blood, especially the ones suffering from the Thalassemia disorder (Matar et al., 2011). Other campaigns include the âFuture without Thalassemiaâ movements conducted during the celebration of the International Thalassemia Day all over the country. This campaign is meant for creating the awareness of the disorder and measures of prevention (Matar et al., 2011). The blood donation programme is also supported by the Emirate Central Cooling Corporation (ECCC) to assist children with the Thalassemia disorder (Matar et al., 2011).

Conclusion

The essay has elaborated the epidemiology, risk factors, and public health programmes that have been put in place to curb the prevalence of the Thalassemia disorder in the UAE. It is noted that the condition has become a public concern. The government of the UAE has put various programmes in place as a step towards the alleviation of the malady. Most of the interventions of the UAE government focus on premarital screening as a sure solution to the problem. Based on the analysis, there is a need to conduct more evidence-based approaches to the implementation of such interventions in the near future.

Introduction

Thalassemia is a genetic disorder of the blood (autosomal recessive disorder) that leads to the abnormal formation of haemoglobin. The condition creates an imbalance between the oxygen and haemoglobin in the patientâs body. Patients diagnosed with the thalassemia disease cannot produce enough haemoglobin; hence, they can suffer from severe anaemia. The organs of such a patient are deprived of oxygen. Consequently, they cannot function effectively. The disorder is referred to as âautosomal recessiveâ since parents with major and minor Thalassemia coupled together with the beta Thalassemia genes have either a higher chance of about 25-percent of bearing children having Thalassemia major or 50-percent likelihood of getting a child with Thalassemia minor. The probability of bearing a child without thalassemia stands at 25-percent. This essay provides a critical analysis of the epidemiology of Thalassemia, risk factors, and public health programmes addressing the issue to both the internal and local health agencies in the United Arab Emirates (UAE).

23,"The United States has one of the worst public school systems in the modern world. Places like Sweden and Denmark show fantastic, flawless designs that allow students to properly use their time for both school and non-school activities. Our public schools, however, show many flaws that were enacted by generations in the past. Students fail to learn proper time management, as they are forced to go to places they are unfamiliar with and follow prepared schedules in and out of class. As this continued, the government discovered the flaws and are beginning to try new solutions. One of these solutions is online classes that students can take at home. I believe that Students would benefit from online learning because it allows the students to learn in places more familiar to them, relearn challenging information, and build proper time management skills.

One of the systems' largest problem is forcing students to attend and learn in places that are unfamiliar and daunting to them. According to majority of students in a poll last year, research has shown that students consider school buildings as uncomfortable, as well as unfamiliar. On that same poll, the same research claimed that students found the idea of learning at home appealing, and a much better suited place to learn. This same evidence supports the ideas that parents whose children are in homeschooling programs share. Hearts, a homeschooling program ran through Generic_City and all over the east coast, has a much larger graduation rate in students and higher averaged grades than public schools in the same areas. Some people could argue that this holds the threat of exposing distractions to students. With the ability to modify their own environment, students can create their own spaces that allow them to concentrate on their studies with ease. All of this information supports the idea that learning at home is a working solution that the government should endorse and improve within their schools.

The second reason that online classing would be a good idea is the ability to allow students to study specifically hard material. Majority of current online classing has a system that allows teachers to record or stream lectures that explain the material. Then, if students had questions, the teacher could answer them in the stream or message the students independently. This method is fantastic, because all of the lectures can be recorded and shown for future reference at other times. If students didn't understand the material, they could just load up the needed information and relearn it and solidify the information into their memory. With this, students can make sure that they received and understood all of the content that they need to know for the classes that they are taking.

Finally, online classing would give students the opportunity to learn valuable time management skills. Along with having control over setting, students would be given control over how they use their time. Homeschooled students often have a lot of time to allocate for school and other activities. This is essential for every student to understand and master, as they will have the same choices when they grow into adults. Students who have other obligations outside of school will be allowed to modify their learning time each day, as well as take breaks from work as needed. Many people argue that students can abuse this opportunity as to skip learning altogether, and allow them to grow bad habits. The entire purpose behind having the choice is to learn from mistakes. If no mistakes were made, then no one could improve. Online classing allows students to learn what to do in a safe and open environment. Without that chance, students would make the same mistakes in more important matters, and harm their well beingÂ later in life.

The largest flaw that has been located is this: some students benefit more from learning in person rather than online. The beauty behind this whole process is that online classes don't eliminate the ability to have face to face classroom interactions that students have today. Yes, online classes are meantÂ to somewhat eliminate this factor, but in person interactions are also needed to have students grow. Hearts, the program mentioned above, has a system that has students meet their teachers in person once or twice a week. This allows teachers to show students real life applications with the information taught in class, as well as give students the ability to have social interaction with both teachers and other students. This allows the students to gain the pros of both online classing and the modern classroom interaction

Students would benefit from online learning because it allows the students to learn in places more familiar to them, relearn challenging topics and units, and build proper time management skills. Throughout this article, evidence has been placed that support all three of these factors. Learning at home gives the students the ability to be taught in more comfortable environments rather than the common classroom. The ability to relearn lectures and other class materials allow students to master the topics given to them. Time management skills can be learned, as the students are given control over the ability to use their time in ways that they think is best. Even some of the common flaws of online classing has been addressed and solved. The ability to change the way we learn is something that I believe is essential to allow minds to reach their highest potential. No one learns the same way as the person next to them. That is why if people are starved of the choice to learn the way that they want, then us as a country will not be able to grow along with the rest of the world. If this method is amplified and improved, then America can become one of the most educated countries on earth.",Human,0,"The United States has one of the worst public school systems in the modern world.

25,"Chocolate Cake and Ice Cream Cake Comparison Essay

Ice cream cake and chocolate cake are very similar, but chocolate cake is better because it is more versatile and rich in flavor. The taste of the chocolate cake is great for anyone who likes chocolate, and the majority of people do. A chocolate cake normally has cocoa in its base, cream, and frosting, which gives it a very rich, intense flavor. This cake usually consists of a sponge base with thick cream in-between layers and frosting on the top.

This gives it a nice mix of textures from soft, melting ones to chewy and moist ones. Finally, the design of chocolate cakes can vary depending on the occasion and on the personâs individual tastes. Chocolate cakes can have fruit, sweets, nuts, or cookies in them, and all of these foods will fit in nicely with the other flavors. Decorating a chocolate cake is easy, because it maintains structure well, allowing to build both a tall, multi-layer cake with elaborate decorations and a small family dessert with a hand-made message.

Ice cream cake differs from the chocolate cake in most of these aspects. The flavor of ice cream is not as rich as that of chocolate. For this reason, the overall taste of ice cream cake is subtle, not rich. The structure of an ice cream cake is similar to chocolate cake and typically involves a sponge cake base with ice cream used in-between layers. The frosting of an ice cream cake can only include whipped cream or ice cream.

This limits the range of textures that can be added. Ice cream is cold and starts melting fast, which destroys the structure of the cake almost immediately. The design of ice cream cakes is usually less appealing because ice cream melts, preventing decorations from staying in place. Hence, chocolate cake is better than ice cream cake because it has more flavor, a variety of textures, and can be decorated in many ways.

27,"In 5th grade, a police officer came and told us to resist peer pressure lest we fall victim to drugs and alcohol. Like many others, I regarded peer pressure as an evil force, only good to ruin lives. I never imagined that it could actually be a tremendously positive influence, but in my life, that is the role peer pressure has played. Without my friends' positive peer pressure and encouragement, I never would have joined a sport, applied for COSMOS, or volunteered at the aquarium. But it did more than just encourage participation in extracurricular activities. I became more outgoing, and as a result, I developed individuality and the willingness to explore my options instead of simply following the ""safest"" path. For much of my life, I had been a shy kid, afraid to take risks or participate in anything beyond the bare minimum. To me, only school was important, while everything else was superfluous. After all, only academics would count for college, right? I had that mentality until my sophomore year, but everything changed when my friends began telling me to become involved in the entire school life and community rather than solely the classes. They urged me to join clubs and sports, arguing that they would be fun and interesting experiences. When I decided to follow their suggestions, my life turned. Before such activities, I was a chameleon, taking on whatever hue was around me and utterly devoid of individuality. But afterward, I was no longer known as the kid that took calculus as a freshman or received an A on that final; instead I became a veritably unique individual, more than just the sum of my achievements. For example, even though I had volunteered at the aquarium, people described me not as the person who volunteered there, but as one who liked to do community service as a way to help charitable causes. Finally, my individual personality was being revealed. As a consequence of participating in more activities, my horizons expanded as I experienced more aspects of life. I realized I could not live life solely through studying and learning, but instead had to actively participate in all walks of life. Without such an epiphany, I never would have joined Key Club and experienced the joy of volunteer work, or done cross-country and realized the importance of a team. Similarly, in college I will not be content living as an introvert, but instead will explore the various offerings of university life, taking advantage of every opportunity. Life does not reward those who wait, but instead rewards those who seek it. Prompt #2: Tell us about a personal quality, talent, accomplishment, contribution or experience that is important to you. What about this quality or accomplishment makes you proud, and how does it relate to the person you are? Wherever I was, I had always felt like an outsider, never quite able to assimilate due to my unique interests and values. But upon attending COSMOS, I finally discovered a location where I could properly assimilate. Whereas high school had a dearth of individuals with interests and beliefs like mine, COSMOS was the utter opposite. Everybody was committed to learning, especially my two favorite subjects, math and science. No longer was I relegated to the role of an outsider; instead, I comfortably worked with other like minded individuals to accomplish common objectives. Shock is not a powerful enough word to describe what I felt; utter disbelief is better. Furthermore, during that time, I realized not only my interest in computer science, but also my own ability, for I, too, was able to run with the swift. One significant interest developed at COSMOS was computer science. I had always loved solving puzzles and searching for the optimal solution to problems, but I had never considered computer science as a fusion of the two interests. However, at COSMOS, I participated in the robotics cluster, which featured a significant amount of programming. While I initially despised it, I began to immensely enjoy it after realizing the entire process was like an elaborate puzzle. When a program I had spent hours working upon finally worked, I would feel an intense elation. For example, after spending hours trying to program a robot to run through a maze while simultaneously reading the barcodes in it, I finally succeeded. That project made me realize what I truly love to do; I do not like rules, but I also do not enjoy unrestricted freedom. Rather, I prefer an environment where restrictions and rules exist, but within those regulations, I am free to do whatever I wish. In the aforementioned example, the only restrictions were that the robot had to run through the maze and read the barcodes, but otherwise, I had free creative reign. To me, that is the appeal of computer science. A rare event occurs when one can delve into a complex academic topic and almost immediately love it, but that is precisely what I experienced. Not only did I develop an interest in computer science, I also gained a deeper insight into my own abilities. At COSMOS, because of the concentration of intellectually committed and curious individuals, group discussions occurred frequently. Despite the difficult topics involved, I was nonetheless able to contribute meaningfully to them. For instance, the instructor once asked us to brainstorm ideas on how to power a robot composed of nanometer sized robots. That required invoking knowledge from a broad spectrum of disciplines, including physics, chemistry, and computing. In regular high school, I was not asked to exercise my brain in such a manner, so I expected I would not be able to contribute to the discussion. But much to my surprise, I did indeed have the ability to synthesize information from the wide range of prior topics I had studied and form ideas based on them. Then, when a guest lecturer came and said he would describe his work with advanced sold-state devices, I panicked since I had never even heard of the topic, much less studied it. But during his actual lecture, I could indeed comprehend his talk. COSMOS was much more than a summer enrichment program. It offered me a taste of college, and I absolutely loved it. The attitude, environment, and the general atmosphere of COSMOS left such a profound impact on me that I changed my entire attitude about learning. Whereas previously I had regarded higher education as simply a barrier to overcome in order to begin working, I now regard college as an exciting opportunity to cultivate my interests and abilities. I eagerly look forward to the prospect of once again being in an intellectually stimulating environment.

28,"I would appreciate some feedback on it. I specifically need help with a good way to end it as my ending is pretty abrupt and cynical at the moment. (I couldn't think of anything) Grades can influence many things. A student's chances of being accepted into his or her dream college, the expectations placed on the students by others and sadly even the way the student's peers view him or her can be based on the student's grades. In this highly competitive generation, grades are seemingly all important, and rightfully so because there must be a way to quantifiable judge a student. Yet this idea has seemingly gone too far, to the point where grades are even influencing the attitudes of students towards certain things. I saw this unfold first hand during the beginning of my sophomore year, due to the summer assigned reading of Withering Heights by Emily BrontÃ«. The English II class at my school is known for giving an insanely difficult test on this book during the first week of school. Prior to the test, my class had intelligent class discussions about the book and everyone claimed to have enjoyed the tale of sin and revenge. Yet, once our horrendous test scores came back to us, not a single person claimed to have enjoyed the book. At first, I thought that it was simply a jovial overreaction to our test scores, claiming that our lives were ruined thanks to the book and the test. However, as time went on, no one seemed to want to change their point of view about the book and soon the book's title became synonymous to something satanic. When I tried to argue the fact that the book itself was actually quite interesting, they all looked at me as though there were some screws loose in my head. In the end, I was only able to get my teacher to agree with me, which wasn't much to my advantage considering that she had made the test which had seemingly caused everyone's opinion of the book to be changed for the worse. At first many of my classmates assumed that I was advocating the book simply because I had gotten a good score on the test, as if I was speaking down upon them from some high up pedestal. Such an assumption raised a question inside me. Did my classmates truly believe that grades were everything and anything that results in a bad grade should be considered some form of taboo? Even after I told them that I had not done very well on the test, they seemed to think that I was some heretic who did not really care about his grades. At the time I had not realized that I was actually challenging anything other than the fact that my classmates thought that the book was not worth reading. However, upon looking back on the incident, I realize that I was challenging the very importance of grades. While school should be a place of learning and gaining knowledge, it has simply become a place to earn a letter grade that will allow one to be considered by colleges and universities. While I too care about grades just as much as my classmates, I did not see a reason to forsake a book and all that could be learned from it simply due to a bad test grade. What I challenged was not something major, it was simply my friends and their assumptions. Yet through this challenge I was able to gain insight into my friends' personalities and how they view education itself. I, someone who is normally quite shy, was able to advocate something that nearly everyone else was against. But perhaps most importantly, I've realized that people's original points of view may be extremely fickle and can easily be swayed. P.S.

Introduction

Due to easy availability of substitutes for most commodities and the increasing number of firms, competition has stiffened as firms try to outdo each other. It is, therefore, the aim of each firm to try and enhance its market share as well as increasing the demand for its goods, so as to increase the profit margin that the firm earns.

Due to the decreasing local demand, many firms have sort of going international and establishing business units in foreign markets. This has been facilitated by the increasingly high correlation between firms from different regions of the world.

Consequently, globalization has resulted, which has lead to emerging of different ways to accomplish various tasks and necessitating improvement in technology besides varying effects both on the people and the companies.

Globalization

This is a term that is used to refer to the linkages between countries which have led to the reduction of barriers of trade not only among neighboring countries, but also with countries all over the world. In many instances, globalization is used to refer to the economic interdependency that has emerged among countries, where countries depend on one another for demand and supply of both raw materials and finished products (Stiglitz 2003).

Globalization involves free movement of goods and services across borders, movement of information and technology from one country to another, and exchange of culture resulting to specialization and comparative advantage, among other advantages.

Effects of Globalization

Globalization has had many far-reaching impacts on the way that firms carry out their functions and the behavior of people, not forgetting the advancement in technology that has helped to propel globalization even more. Economically, the volume of trade has been increasing over the years since countries agreed to open their boundaries to international markets.

Countries have increased demand for their goods which has made them increase their production, thereby increasing employment besides increasing their profitability (Steger 2010).

On the same note, due to reduced barriers to trade, many firms, especially from the developed countries, have invested in developing countries creating employment opportunities for the people who could have remained unemployed, therefore improving the economy of these countries (Braudreaux 2008).

Due to the competition, companies are constantly researching ways of improving their products so that they can stand a chance of competing favorably. This, in turn, has led to increased research and development and consequently advancement technology hence, coming up with more efficient ways of production as well as value addition on end products.

In conjunction with that, there has been increased concern about the conditions of work and the safety of the workplaces for employees of various companies in the wake of globalization. This has made many companies to change the working conditions for their employees, especially in developing countries, where terms of employment, as well as working conditions, were bad.

Employees have, therefore gained immensely due to globalization (Steger 2010). On top of that, the companies have found enough market that has encouraged expansionary decisions due to high demand, thus, leading to an increase in output and consequently revenues.

Additionally, people have gained significantly through globalization in different positive ways. To begin with, there has been an increase in employment opportunities because one can search for employment even in foreign countries or in the foreign firms that invest in their local economy.

On the same note, foreign firms have always had to employ people from different cultural backgrounds, which has necessitated employee training so as to enhance good coexistence (Lechner 2009). Employees have been on the receiving end as their knowledge has constantly been improving.

Furthermore, globalization has enabled people to access various goods and services which are not produced in their country, therefore, increasing their choices besides improving their living standards.

However, globalization has not only positive impacts on the globe but also some negative ones as well. Due to globalization, companies have been hiring even from foreign countries which have led to migration of skilled workers from the developing countries to developed countries where wages are high, and working conditions are better.

Globalization has also led to developing countries borrowing from the rich countries thereby, becoming economically and technologically dependent on the rich countries, which have allowed rich countries to control the economic and political affairs of developing countries (Stiglitz 2003).

Globalization and Outsourcing

Outsourcing refers to the process of contracting another firm to perform certain functions which were being performed internally, in order to gain competitive advantage or increase efficiency in execution of these duties. Some firms go to the extent of transferring the whole department to the outsourced firm, including the employees (Lechner 2009).

Globalization has also increased the ability of firms from developed countries to access cheaper labor from developing countries where wage rates are low. This has made these firms to reduce the number of employees in the developed countries while they increase their outsourcing from the emerging markets.

Consequently, rich countries have found themselves in a mess as employment is shifting to emerging markets while employment rates are declining in the developed countries due to high labor costs.

Information Technology and Globalization

Globalization has led to rapid improvement in the information technology sector due to the need to communicate with both customers and suppliers in various parts of the world, while at the same time firms are striving to use the most recent technology in production.

It is evident that information technology has led to improved access of information, which has led to increased efficiency in the way tasks are accomplished as well as raising the economic potential of firms (Schwalbe 2009). Advances in computer software and modes of communication have also enhanced information exchange between various regions, as well as enabling digital processing of information, thus increasing convenience.

On top of that, the widespread use of internet has improved the speed of communication and modes of marketing various products. Thus, making it easy for a firm to sell its products in foreign markets. The internet has also brought revolution in the way people make decisions and organize for production.

Additionally, management can be carried out from different places since the internet has made it possible for meetings to be held online through teleconferencing, which facilitates decision making (Schwalbe 2009). Furthermore, it is possible for people to get anything they want online be it a job, a product or information about a given company.

Conclusion

Globalization has led to advancement in the way companies accomplish their activities through increasing efficiency, thus, enhancing competitive advantage. Information technology is an inevitable component, and a driving force for that matter, which pushes globalization and should be handled with care because without it, globalization cannot prosper.

However, globalization has negative effects also which should be taken into consideration for they may end up being detrimental to world economies if not adequately addressed.

33,"Economics: Episode 6 of âCapitalismâ Documentary Essay

Karl Polanyiâs economic theory must be one of the most ambiguous in the history of economic thought. On the one hand, his views contradict the existence or, most likely, the advantageousness of the self-regulating market system described by Adam Smith. From this perspective, Polanyiâs economic views coincide with those of Keynes who insisted on the need for the governmentâs active regulation of the market growth.

In the meantime, while Keynes simply rejects the potential of the invisible hand of the market, Polanyi develops this idea and comes to a conclusion that the liberalistic attempt to establish the self-regulating market system is the root of all the worldâs âcatastrophesâ (âEpisode 6â). On the face of it, such a parallel might seem to be an exaggeration. Meanwhile, a brief retrospective overview shows that the marketâs self-regulation does not essentially imply positive outcomes for the society; on the contrary, it often leads to the disastrous consequences. Thus, for instance, the capitalâs mobility that, while being uncontrolled, is certainly an integral part of the self-regulated basis, has already become the cause of the overall unemployment.

Polanyiâs criticism of the capitalistic system appears to be aligned to that expressed by Marx. Hence, the former economist also puts an emphasis on the ethical prevalence of social needs over the profit motives (âEpisode 6â). Meanwhile, his theory reminds that of Marx only at the first sight. Thence, a closer analysis reveals that Polanyiâs views are more âhumanistic.â The economist is mainly focused on the examination of the human character trying to determine such forms of market structure that would be most resonant to the inborn nature of a person.

This humanistic approach is illustrated by Polanyiâs numerous references to the historical background; hence, the economist tries to overview the entire scope of the humansâ experience. Despite his criticism of the free market, he is still less dogmatic in his attitude towards its mechanisms than Marx. Generally speaking, it might be concluded that Karl Polanyi generated one of the most rational and grounded economic theories. His theory avoids extremes; instead, it proclaims the reasonably balanced liberal and democratic market system.

Describe Business Challenge or Opportunity

Describe the business challenge (or opportunity) for which a digital transformation/business model may be a viable solution.

  * The âopportunity of new business models for traditional competitorsâ threat;
  * Currently, the company uses standard approaches to construction;
  * Digital transformation of the way industrial buildings are constructed is happening;
  * Internet of things (IoT) and smart buildings;
  * New business model â designing and constructing industrial facilities with the integration of IoT.

The industrial construction is the industry is a complex and often multidisciplinary field, which implies that implementing a digital transformation is a challenging task. In the case of AYTB, the opportunity lies in the way the industrial construction is perceived and how technology integration can make plants and other manufacturing facilities more efficient.

The disruption that the industry faces is the new business model for traditional competitors â more and more companies begin to use the Internet of things (IoT) and smart technology that employs sensors and other technology that allows the owner of a facility to collect information and adjust devices that were integrated into the building for more efficient and comfortable use of its facilities. While currently, this type of disruption mostly affects civil engineering, in the form of smart homes, in the nearest future, the IoT technology will transform the way factory construction and maintenance, as well as other types of industrial construction work, are viewed.

Letâs examine AYTB using the digital business model framework.

What is the digital threatâand opportunity?

  * Threat â manufacturing facilities will integrate IoT devices into their buildings.
  * Opportunity â provision of design and construction services to facilities with IoT integration.
  * 30% of revenue if under threat.
  * 7 out of 10 chance for disruption of AYTBâs leading service.
  * Measured through an assessment and comparison with the civil engineering industry.
  * Senior managementâ mindset is affected by the slow changes within the industry.

Firstly, letâs begin an assessment by defining the digital threat. Based on the rough estimations, around 30% of the revenue is threatened by this digital transformation. AYTB is a multidimensional company, and its revenue comes not only from construction but also from maintenance, turnaround, and other services. One way to assess the digital threat is to examine the likelihood of AYTBâs best selling product being disrupted, which numerically can be expressed as 7 out of 10.

Senior managementâs mindset has a direct impact on the assessment of the threat because industrial construction is a well-established industry, which is highly regulated by the government, and standards of construction and changes within it usually take a lot of time.

Action: What percentage of your revenues that are under threat of digital disruption?

The answer sheet above contains an assessment of AYTBâs current service â industrial construction.

Based on this assessment, AYTBâs service is moderately threatened by digital disruption. The main benefit is that AYTB provides a tangible product to its customers â such as foundations, pavements, and actual buildings, which cannot be replaced with a digital alternative. This service will not be delivered through digital alternatives, although some parts of the process, such as creating a plan, meeting with the customer, discussing the construction, and others can be done digitally, they are not AYTBâs main filed of work. However, competitors can offer more efficient services by employing the integration of sensors connected to IoT that will create industrial buildings that are more efficient.

Based on this assessment, the percentage of revenue that is under threat is approximately 30%.

Which business model is best for your enterpriseâs future?

Omnichannel:

  * Services of industrial construction.
  * Maintenance.
  * Facility management.
  * Working with brown and green facility construction.
  * Material procurement.
  * Etc.

Next, we will examine what AYTB is currently doing, its business model, value chain, and customers. AYTB is an omnichannel business because it has created a multiproduct for its customers, from working with brown or green, or contaminated and not contaminated land, to producing materials, constructing, and managing the facility. Hence, its business is a part of the value chain, rather than an ecosystem, meaning that it can be controlled more easily, which is usually the case with B2B companies. AYTBâs customers come from across Saudi Arabia and are established businesses in different industries â oil and gas, chemical, power plants, and others.

Action: Target your digital business model.

Assessment: Four digital business models.

Ecosystem drivers outperform all other business models on four measures for performance.

DBM               Customer Experience  Time to Market  Revenue Growth  Net profit Margin
Supplier          65%                  50%             33%             34%              
Omnichannel       80%                  75%             40%             40%              
Modular Producer  70%                  63%             43%             46%              
Ecosystem Driver  80%                  78%             51%             50%              


Notably, the ecosystem driver model is more effective, because it allows the business to have a greater customer choice, allows to implement innovation more quickly, and offer the best prices. However, as was mentioned, the extent to which AYTB can implement digital transformation as part of its operations is limited by the tangible nature of its services. From the table above, one can see that moving from the value chain model to a different strategy, in general, can be beneficial for AYTB because it will allow for substantial revenue growth and profit margin growth.

What is your digital competitive advantage?

Action: Identify your source of competitive advantage.

Assessment: Competitive advantage.

Next, AYTBâs competitive advantage should be identified and discussed. Currently, its main advantage is the wide variety of services it provides to its clients, essentially, AYTB can construct from scratch any type of a plant or manufacturing facility, procuring the materials and producing some of them, and offer long term support to its customers by maintaining the buildings, and offering facility management services.

Considerations:

 1. Do you continually add new or refreshed content?
 2. Do you know how good your customer experience is?
 3. How good are your digital platforms? E.g., cloud, SAS, partners, external data?

AYTBâs âcontentâ is its services, and the business has an established set of industrial construction services it provides that are not often updated, mainly, the changes are connected to legal requirements relating to construction standards. However, the current content is valued by the customers because of the broad range of services AYTB offers, essentially, everything a company may need in terms of construction and facility management can be done by AYTB. The responsibility for digital and physical products is help by different teams since AYTB only recently decided to evaluate the benefit of integrating digitalization and IoT in its service range. It should be noted that currently, AYTB does not generate revenue online, since its contracts are mainly signed through meetings with clients, which is another opportunity for growth.

AYTB typically works with customers long-term, which is the first indicator of the excellent quality of services it provides. Additionally, it uses benchmarking and assessment of customer satisfaction to determine the quality of its services. It is highly probable that at the current rate of digitalization, the customers will be frustrated with AYTBâs lack of integrating the IoT in the building construction and lack of digital services to support facility management.

AYTB uses digital platforms in its internal operations â to collect and analyze data and manage projects, which are mainly done through the cloud. This may be a challenge for a digital transformation because AYTB will have to find new partners or develop new solutions by itself to address IoT and other opportunities.

In this slide, each of the three sources of competitive advantage can be seen rated on the basis of their importance now and in three years and their order of importance. This assessment helps identify the main area that should be addressed as part of digital transformation. Here, the most significant change is attributed to the platform, which ranks as five today and 8 in three years, with the level of importance of 2. It is because AYTB should focus on integrating a digital solution for supporting the development and maintenance of the industrial facilities it constructs, for example, to allow the customers to monitor the energy expenditures of their buildings, temperature, and more intricate things such as a number of employees, output and other metrics through AYTBâs services and integration of IoT sensors. This is also linked to the content that AYTB offers since the integration of sensors that will allow collecting and analyzing this data will become extremely important within the next three years.

How will you connect using mobile and IoT?

Considerations:

 1. How are you using mobile to manage digital assets and create value?
 2. What opportunities for value creation does IoT offer your enterprise?

Currently, AYTBâs integration with digital platforms is moderate, and the company does not use mobile to create additional value. IoT offers a completely different approach to the way AYTB constructs buildings, manages its operations and provides facility management services. Mainly, this can be achieved by integrating sensors into the facilities it constructs and providing clients with a digital platform where this information is collected and can be presented to them created more value to the clients.

Based on this self-assessment, the average score for mobile readiness is 30 out of fifty, although top-margin enterprises show 35 points out of fifty. Improvements can be made in the domain of capturing and utilizing customer data from mobile channels, and more attention can be dedicated to integrating API. In terms of IoT readiness, the average score for AYTB is 18 out of 50 and 29 out of 50 for top margin enterprises. Here, an issue arises because IoTâs importance in construction is becoming more and more important, and AYTB will have to integrate it into its services to maintain a competitive advantage. Evidently, the main issue is the need to persuade the management of the necessity to address the disruption that is about to happen.

What are the crucial capabilities to reinvent the enterprise?

8 Crucial Capabilities:

  * Capabilities for Moving Up on the DBM Framework:
      + Gathering and using customer data about life events.
      + Amplifying the customer voice inside the enterprise.
      + Creating a culture of evidence-based decision-making.
      + Providing an integrated, multiproduct, multichannel customer experience.
  * Capabilities for Moving Right on the DBM Framework:
      + Being distinctive and the first place your best customers go when a need arises.
      + Identifying and developing great partnerships and acquisitions.
      + Service-enabling what makes you greatâwith exposed APIs.
      + Developing efficiency, security, and compliance competencies.

In terms of crucial capabilities to reinvent the enterprise, which requires a vision for how IoT and digitalization will be integrated into AYTBâs processes and what value this will provide to the consumer. It is evident that AYTB should start with creating a digital culture â dedicating more attention to the use of digital tools and platforms when working with clients, managing employees and operations, and for other activities. The DBM network helps address this problem by providing a structure for changes that AYTB can adopt. Based on the DBM, AYTB can choose to transform into the ecosystem, by moving up and then to the right in the DBM structure, but this is a highly challenging path.

Arguably, AYTB has young leaders who believe in the need to predict disruptions and respond to them. Its top management is accepting of new ideas and changes when their beneficial impact on the value provided by AYTB outweighs the costs and risks associated with the implementation of the IoT. This creates a good basis for the new and more digitally oriented culture and the implementation of innovational technical capabilities.

Do you have the crucial capabilities to reinvent the enterprise?

Action: Build and strengthen the eight key capabilities.

Assessment: Digital capabilities.

Here, the score target is 70, with 8% of the companies being ready for the transformation. This shows that AYTB has some of the key capabilities that will allow reinventing itself when addressing digital disruption. Moreover, because AYTB incorporates a large number of enterprises and company branches, it is vital to focus on improving these capabilities across these entities, with the main focus on gathering and utilizing data about customer life experience and amplifying their voice inside AYTB to provide services that can better satisfy the needs of the clients. One example of this can be the integration of data science as the main analytics approach to collect and analyze data about AYTBâs partnerships. To move right with the DBM framework, AYTB may choose to create a digital platform where customers can order its services, such as building maintenance, use AYTBâs IoT capabilities to examine their buildings, and communicate with AYTBâs support. Here, the integration of API becomes essential.

Do you have the leadership to make the transition happen?

Action: Develop your leaders and invest in your culture.

Assessment: People and culture.

Key Roles                      Responsibilities                                                                           
The Board of Directors           * Strategy, oversight, defense.                                                          
                                 * Make transformation choices, set pace of change, define success, select change leaders.
The CEO & Executive Committee    * Communicate.                                                                           
                                 * Drive and reinforce cultural changes.                                                  
                                 * Senior management: Be change facilitators.                                             
The Workforce                    * Get involved/support the change.                                                       
                                 * Learn new skills.                                                                      
                                 * Spend time with external customers.                                                    
The CIO                          * Focus on innovation.                                                                   
                                 * Deeply engage executive committee.                                                     


The leadership can either help make the changes easy and feel effortless as innovation, and new processes are integrated into the business, or place many obstacles that will make these changes impossible. Arguably, AYTB has the leadership who possess skills and expertise to make the change happen. This assessment considers the leaders from the top and down levels, which improves the chances of AYTB becoming an ecosystem driver. It is evident that the process of change must be top-down since AYTB consists of many smaller enterprises, and to facilitate simultaneous change, the Board has to create a strategy and communicate it to the CEOs and the workforce.

Finally, the digital capabilities of the Board inevitably affect their mindset and readiness to change. In AYTBâs case, the self-assessment scores show 60 out of 100, showcasing that the Board may not perceive the proposed digitalization and IoT changes as necessary. This is a very good result, considering the score of top performers in Weil and Woernerâs book is 68. Hence, AYTB has a good potential to enable changes towards digital transformation, and the development of the digital culture enacted bu the Board, and CEOs should help the process of digitalization. To conclude, digital disruption can be viewed as an opportunity for AYTB because the company is well-established, with a wide range of services for its customers and, based on the assessments, is ready to integrate innovation into its operations. The main focus is on moving from the omnichannel model to the ecosystem driver strategy. Using the DBM framework, AYTB should move up by gaining a better understanding of its customers, and than move right by becoming a distinctive company for its customers.

39,"Compensation and Benefits Research Paper

An employee is a vital component to an organization. Management of this component is essential for an organization to achieve success. The main objective of an organization is making profit and be successful in keeping her competitors at bay.

Firms which have been able to unite brains have been able to achieve their set goals. Organizations need to ensure that the positions in the organization are filled and anytime there is a vacant position, appropriate actions need to be undertaken to ensure the positions remain filled (Stoner, Freeman & Gilbert, 2003).

This will ensure that there is no backlog of work and that the firmâs systems are operational at any given time. The employee is responsible for the implementation of the firms plan. Sound human resource policies are important in the selection and recruitment of employees. This will ensure that the firm has the right people to fill various positions (Koontz, 1961).

Good working conditions and a competitive salary is also vital to motivate the employees towards achieving the organization dream. Human resources, a body responsible for hiring and firing employees, are tasked to prepare salary scales of the workers to be approved by top-level management. The article aims to discuss compensations and benefits system. In addition, the importance of Holland Enterprises to increase its expenditure base to enhance organizational success is also discussed.

How an effective compensation and benefit system contributes to organizational effectiveness

Compensation and benefits system of an organization is vital to cope with the day-to-day competition posted by competing firms. This scheme helps ensure employees are motivated at all times.

According to recent researches, employee motivation is directly related to the level of production in that the more an employee feels he is cared for the more he will be induced to contribute fully to the firmâs revenue (Bonner et al., 2006).

An effective benefit system ensures that all company employees are taken care of as far as their salaries, enumerations and benefit schemes are concerned. In addition, an effective system ought to be in line with the market levels. Compensations are either monetary or non-monetary.

Monetary compensation has money value attached to it while the non-monetary compensation entails recognition and improving working environment. The appreciation of an achievement is enough to retain a worker in the firm. Firms with a strong reward system have managed to keep employees in their systems for long as compared to firms with weak or no compensation systems at all (Bell, 2007).

Organizational culture is a necessity in the success of a firm. An effective compensations and benefits system helps nurture this culture. The designation of a compensation system is in accordance to the company objectives and goals.

Therefore, given the reinforcement of the organizational culture, companies will relatively realize massive success. Compensation and benefits system is designed primarily incorporating the objectives of the firm (Bell, 2007). The aforementioned initiative is meant to entwine a benefit with a goal; a benefit is attached to the achievement of a goal.

In addition, the harmonization of an organization compensation strategy enables the firm to retain the already attracted talent. This retained talent is important to the success of the firm in that it has massive experience to be used to the advantage of the firm. In accordance to the recruitment requirements of most organizations, trainings are part of the process. Losing of these brains to the competitors is a double tragedy to the firm as important information about the firm will be lost to the competitors.

Organization information in the hands of a competitor is harmful to the company-formulated policies as the competitor can counter the firmâs moves. Retaining the trained and talented staff is paramount to maintain the organizationâs secrets and use them to the companyâs advantage. This is achieved through the establishment of a sound compensation and benefits systems that covers all the employees.

Attracting and retaining the right personnel in the firm enhances success. This is because of the competence that transforms the daily operations in the firm. The competent individuals streamline the systems resulting to customer satisfaction, hence the increase of business. Employees are sensitive to the equitability in the salary scales, and for firms to realize massive motivation. Compensations systems help root out inequitable systems that lower morale hence increasing organizational success.

The principle components of a typical compensation and benefit system for a large-scale organization

Organization compensation and benefits philosophy helps a firm to attract and retain competent well skilled employees. Constant review of this philosophy is important to ensure it is in line with the market and individual performance. In giving a competitive package in terms of salaries and other initiatives, an organization is able to attract brilliant brains from competing firms.

This is vital to the thriving of the firmâs activities. The philosophy review ought to address the individual unrelenting service to the firm in each level. This ensures the recognition of individual contribution to the success of the firm. Performance of individuals is related to the business unit success. The company philosophy ensures that successful units are both recognized with monetary or non-monetary rewards.

This encourages competition within units of the company hence enhancing the amount of revenues. Moreover, a firmâs philosophy is about the wellbeing of the employee; this is looked in terms of the health, and other retirement benefits. A nice philosophy is sensitive to the life of an employee and how the worker skills can be improved in terms of additional training in the field of specialization (Bonner et al., 2006).

Compensation benefits systems need to be sensitive when designing an all inclusive pay structure. A well-designed structure needs to factor in both internal and external salary grading. The systemâs compliance with the labor legislations together with the market salary wave is important (Bonner et al., 2006).

Salary scales need to match with those in the market. Subsequent benefits need to be better than for the traditional competitors. The pay structure that addresses the expectations of the employees is a necessity if a system is to be stable. The difference between job grades need to be based on merit and the level of responsibility to ensure that employees do not feel discriminated. This will maintain mutual respect and avoid sabotages at the work place.

Ratio of base pay to incentive pay is an important component of a compensation and benefits systems. An organization system rewards need to be based on the dedication of employees to service. The ratio between base pay and incentives vary between employees of different levels.

Base pay increase needs to be based on the extra hours an employee has sacrificed on behalf of the firm. The reward will encourage additional dedication from the employee and induce others to follow suit. In addition, the system can give a pay rise in relation to the job skills of an employee. The increase in incentive pay is meant to trigger performance. A higher pay will highly motivate employees.

Equity is the nerve of a compensation and benefits systems. Employees need to be treated with utmost respect and need to feel equal with their fellow employees and colleagues in competing firms. This is a sensitive issue to balance and it calls for extensive research to ascertain the salary and remuneration levels applied in the market.

Employees feel motivated when they feel they are considered equal with their colleagues. Any act of inequality will affect the firmâs success negatively as it demoralizes the worker. Transparent systems nurture trust among employees and also their trust towards the organization. Avoidance of secrets in the compensation system is paramount to nurture motivation and prevent worker exits.

Compensation and benefits systems are manmade and therefore prone to errors. However, the strategy is to enable it fully comply with the postulated legislations which guide workers. The strategy of this system is to keep the competitive advantage of a firm while maintaining the satisfaction of employees. The system rewards effort and endurance by workers. Pay and rewards increases with increase in the performance levels.

The employeesâ life is important and the certainties of the future through sound retirement policies are important to motivate and keep employees in an organization for long periods (Bunderson, 2003). In accordance to the vivid explanation, it is paramount for Holland enterprise to increase the margin of its compensation and benefits expenditure. The initiative is prudent as the discussion elaborates the benefits to be accrued when an employee is taken care of.

Introduction

The concept of overpopulation of the planet is not new. There is a finite amount of space and resources that the planet can offer, and technological advances can only mitigate the situation so much. The first scholar to consider the idea of overpopulation was Thomas Malthusian, who brought it up in a work called âAn Essay on the Principle of Population.â He managed to outline the reasons for population growth such as the improvement of standards of living, an abundance of food, and advanced medicine (Barbier 4).

When Malthusian made his predictions, however, he did not consider technological progress. The apocalypse he predicted was averted through innovations in technology and agriculture. Today, in 2016, humanity faces the problem of overpopulation once more. Despite many who dismiss the threat of overpopulation, it is much more real now than it was in 1796, as natural resources are now much fewer than they used to be and the population â much larger.

Causes of Overpopulation

Although different scholars point to different factors that influence population growth, the core ones remain the same. These factors include the following:

  * Advances in food production and agriculture;
  * Advances in industry and production;
  * Advances in medicine; and
  * Poor family planning (Barbier 92).

It is obvious that these four factors are the ones that affect population growth the most. Advances in food production and agriculture create a surplus of food, which allows for population growth without famine as a natural barrier to curb it. Advances in industry and production provide clothes and items for the growing population to use, thus creating and maintaining a higher standard of living. Modern medicine curbs child mortality and effectively prolongs peoplesâ lives.

Lastly, poor family planning means families become large and produce many children, with no regard for how it affects the environment. Together, these factors have contributed greatly to the incredible population growth rates today.

Effects of Overpopulation

Many scholars have identified the disastrous effects overpopulation has on the environment. There are main three points of concern to which overpopulation will inevitably lead:

  * Depletion of natural resources;
  * Degradation of the environment; and
  * Resource wars (Barbier 75).

With consumer culture on the rise, the population requires increasingly more materials to maintain their high standards of living. Everybody wants to have an iPhone, and everybody feels the need to have a personal vehicle. While certain resources, such as wood and energy, are renewable, the rest are not. Eventually, Earth will face a resource crisis, which is only sped up by the ever-increasing population (Toth and Szigeti 284).

More people mean a quicker degradation of the environment. Humanity, in general, has a negative influence on nature. Therefore, the more humans there are, the worse the impact is. This fact is especially true for developing countries, where advances in medicine and agriculture promote population growth, but eco-technologies and recycling are not yet implemented (Cafaro and Crist 75).

As natural resources become more and more depleted, resource wars will follow. Covert resource wars are already being waged, as major powers confront one another over the oil basins located in the Middle East. This competition will become even fiercer in the future as non-renewable resources become less and less common.

Solutions to Overpopulation

There are two popular paths to take when trying to solve the overpopulation problem. The first deals with the roots of overpopulation itself and are aimed at lowering the number of births through state programs, family planning, sex education, and other such initiatives. Such a strategy is already implemented in China, where the government imposes severe financial penalties for having more than one child. The country was forced to face the overpopulation problem earlier than most due to the unprecedented population growth it experienced in the decades prior.

The second route is not aimed at lowering the population but rather at providing for them. This approach involves recycling, using renewable energy, developing eco-clean technologies, and implementing other ideas that slow down and reduce the damage caused by the excess population. Looking for materials and resources outside the planet is futuristic, but it represents a viable strategy nonetheless. Eventually, humanity will have to look for resources in space, as it is impossible to create a completely self-sustaining resource model â some resources will inevitably be lost in the recycling process.

Combining both of these paths into one all-consuming strategy seems like the most reasonable and effective approach to mitigating the problem of overpopulation. Introducing statewide policies on birth control â in addition to popularizing recycling, using renewable energy, and minimizing the damage to the environment â would severely reduce the dangers presented by overpopulation and would buy humanity more time to find a permanent solution (Barbier 184).

Conclusion

As it stands, the effort to combat overpopulation is in its infancy. Outside of a couple of concerned governments who have to deal with overpopulation at home, nobody seems to give the issue the proper attention it deserves. If humanity is to overcome this problem, a united stance and a complex approach are required. This effort would require cooperation between different nations on all levels, as well as a vast informative campaign to make sure the general populace understands the need for such initiatives. Without such a joint effort, any local attempt to deal with the situation at home would have a limited effect.

Introduction

The concept of overpopulation of the planet is not new. There is a finite amount of space and resources that the planet can offer, and technological advances can only mitigate the situation so much. The first scholar to consider the idea of overpopulation was Thomas Malthusian, who brought it up in a work called âAn Essay on the Principle of Population.â He managed to outline the reasons for population growth such as the improvement of standards of living, an abundance of food, and advanced medicine (Barbier 4).

When Malthusian made his predictions, however, he did not consider technological progress. The apocalypse he predicted was averted through innovations in technology and agriculture. Today, in 2016, humanity faces the problem of overpopulation once more. Despite many who dismiss the threat of overpopulation, it is much more real now than it was in 1796, as natural resources are now much fewer than they used to be and the population â much larger.",0.61328125,1

47,"Sicilian Mafia in the US Before and After John Gotti Research Paper

There can be only a few doubts that during the 20 th centuryâs first half, the Italian (Sicilian) Mafia used to affect the socio-economic realities in the U.S. to a considerable extent. The Mafiaâs influence on the domestic body politics in Americaâs Northeast remained rather sizable up until the late-eighties â the story of John Gotti illustrates the validity of this suggestion perfectly well. Nevertheless, as of today, this effectively ceased to be the case. Even though the affiliates of Cosa Nostra continue to take part in a number of the semi-legal moneymaking activities, associated with the American way of life (such as gambling, for example), the Italian Mafioso is no longer in the position to affect the functioning of this countryâs legal system.

Such a development appears to have been predetermined by the objective laws of history. After all, it was only the matter of time before the continual empowerment of the countryâs legally legitimate corporate/banking sector, which continues to be dominated by the so-called WASPs (White Anglo-Saxon Protestants), would naturally prompt it to aspire to take control of the most lucrative criminal enterprises in America â something that marginalized the Italian Mafiaâs power rather substantially. In my paper, I will aim to explore the validity of this suggestion at length.

It nowadays represents a commonplace assumption that it was named the introduction of the so-called âProhibition Lawâ in 1920, which made the Italian Mafia an integral part of the discourse Americana, as we know it (Kelly 79). After all, the Mafiaâs initial activities used to be concerned with bootlegging, as the way to make enormous profits without having to apply much of an effort. What came in particularly handy for the Italian Mafioso, in this respect, was their endowment with the primitively-rural mentality, extrapolated in what later became known as the Italian Mafiaâs âtrademarksâ â the code of silence ( Omerta ), the strongly defined sense of nationalism (only Italians can be made men ), the highly hierarchic structure of each crime-family, and the fact the Italian Mafioso has always been known for their adherence to the traditional/religious values.

The reason for this is that, as opposed to what it used to be the case with American society of the time, in which people (predominantly Anglo-Saxons) were encouraged to believe that the relationship between the authority (government) and ordinary citizens was âverticalâ, the Italian Mafia was able to introduce another kind of non-governmental âhorizontalâ authority, enforced by the power that comes âout of the barrel of a gunâ. In other words, the early successes of the Italian Mafia have been predetermined by the fact that, throughout the 20 th centuryâs twenties and thirties, Italian immigrants in American large cities were able to create their own (essentially rural) society within the society, to which the American secular (urban) law did not apply. Thus, the highly romanticized Hollywood accounts of the Italian Mafia, which depict the heads of crime-families (Dons) being regarded benefactors by the whole communities of Italian immigrants, are thoroughly adequate.

However, as time went on, the Italian Mafiaâs strengths, concerned with establishing the âhorizontalâ links between the affiliates, began to backfire. For example, one of the reasons why throughout the fifties and sixties the Mafiaâs power started to decline is that at the time several Dons refused to get involved in drug-trafficking â partially, due to these individualsâ genuine belief in âfamily-valuesâ. As Reuter noted: âThe (Italian) Mafia has failed to maintain control of the New York heroin market and has been a marginal player in the cocaine business everywhereâ (91). What also contributed to the process is that, throughout the mentioned period, the number of Italian immigrants (from Italyâs rural areas) decreased rather drastically.

This created the situation when, as of the early seventies, the overwhelming majority of Mafioso consisted of the second and third-generation Italian-Americans, who were not quite as enthusiastic about observing the âold rulesâ as their predecessors, on one hand, and of those who nevertheless preferred sticking to these rules, on the other. As a consequence, the intensity of internal tensions within the Italian crime-families continued to increase exponentially â something that had a strongly negative effect on the Mafia membersâ overall ability to get away with committing crimes.

The Gambino crime family, which came to prominence during the seventies, illustrates the validity of this suggestion perfectly well. After having been appointed the Don, Paul Castellano began to alter the traditional ways of conducting business in the family, which in turn was met with fierce resistance, on the part of the familyâs capos , such as John Gotti. The latter ended up murdering Castellano (1985) and taking his position, as the boss, while assuring the rest of the family members that he would be able to run the business as usual. In particular, the specifics of Gottiâs Don-rule can be outlined as follows:

a. The selection of the capos / underbosses was done in close observance with the so-called âprepotenzaâ-principle. As Bovenkerk pointed out: âSome people have a certain natural authority. It is something Italians call prepotenza. Anyone who has ever looked the Sicilian Told Riina in the face, even on a magazine cover, understands why people just do what he wants them toâ (237). In its turn, this allowed Gotti to ensure that the familyâs key-figures did have what it takes to exercise effective leadership. At the same time, however, this resulted in lowering the overall intellectual level of the familyâs main functionaries â something that explains why most of these individuals (including Gotti himself) ended up falling easy prey to the legal traps, set for them by the FBI.

b. The practice of racketeering was elevated to account for one of the familyâs prioritized activities. Gotti also used to pay much attention to what was a particular personâs âstreet reputationâ, before deciding to promote him through the ranks. As a result, throughout the years 1985-1992, the rate of premeditated homicide in New York saw a steady rise.

c. Much effort used to be applied in ensuring Gottiâs positive publicity with New Yorkers, as well as with the rest of American citizens. Gotti has made it an unofficial order that the members of the Gambino family are never caught committing crimes that people find especially despicable, such as rape. Gotti used to believe that being in favor of New Yorkers would allow him to continue thwarting the FBIâs attempts to nail him (Lombardi and Capeci 29).

Nevertheless, the fact that Gotti strived to run the family in more of an old-fashioned way did not help him to avoid being sentenced to spend the rest of his life in prison (1992), without the possibility to apply for parole. Quite to the contrary â it helped to seal his fate more than anything else did. The rationale behind this suggestion case can be formulated as follows:

Throughout the mentioned historical period, America has been set on the path of corporatization â all in full accordance with the provisions of neo-Liberalism, which calls for the abandonment/reduction of governmental control over the functioning of large transnational corporations/banks. However, as history shows, the lesser is such a control, the more these organizations strive to become the independent subjects of their own, which either overtake the functions of the government or exercise a heavy influence on the legislative/judicial processes in this country (Sionneau 331).

When it happens, the law ceases to be impartial â something that used to allow the Italian crime-families to proliferate in the past. After all, the line that divides the legally legitimate activities of transnational corporations/banks, on one hand, and the illegitimate/immoral activities of the Italian Mafia, on the other, is rather imaginary. In this respect, Bovenkerk came up with a good observation: âIn the business world, legal activities can turn into illegal ones, and they are often carried out at the same time and by the same people. The only reason why the distinction has to be maintained is that different concepts and theories have been developed for business crimeâ (236). In plain words, the most powerful representatives of Americaâs corporate sector began to perceive the Gambino family as such that competes with them for essentially the same wealth-generating resources.

Given the fact that the amount of these resources is limited and also the fact that those who control the government (through âlobbyingâ) are also in by-proxy control of the secret services/the courts of law, it did not prove a particular challenge throwing Gotti and many of his cronies in jail for life. Once the corporate agenda is at stake, the law can be âbentâ. This is the reason why, despite his admission of having committed multiple murders on behalf of Gotti, Salvatore Gravano (Gottiâs underboss ) was sentenced to only three years in jail and allowed to apply for the Witness Protection Program â all in exchange for the concerned personâs agreement to testify against his former boss. The same explains why during the case hearing, the judge simply refused to take into consideration that there was a strong lack of legal soundness to the manner, in which incriminating evidence against Gotti was collected, in the first place â something that should not have been the case, had this hearing proceeded in strict accordance with the word of the law.

After all, the annual income of the Gambino family used to account for $300-$500 million, at best â a joke, as compared to what accounts for the annual income of an average transnational corporation in America. This shows once again that in its confrontation with the legally legitimate and enormously wealthy âmafiaâ of the countryâs actual owners, any ethnic Mafia (such as the Italian one) simply does not stand a chance â especially if, due to the specifics of their ethnocultural background, the affiliates of the latter happened to be highly emotional but not particularly bright individuals.

I believe that the deployed earlier line of argumentation, as to the discursive significance of the phenomenon of the Italian Mafia, in general, and John Gotti, in particular, is consistent with the initially provided thesis.

Cultural appropriation in the arts has become a highly debated topic in recent years. It refers to the adoption or use of elements of one culture by members of another culture, often without acknowledgment or respect for the original culture. This phenomenon has raised concerns about cultural misrepresentation, exploitation, and erasure. In this paper, we will explore the concept of cultural appropriation in the arts, its historical context, and its impact on society.

The issue of cultural appropriation in the arts has been around for centuries. It can be traced back to the colonial era when European artists and writers appropriated indigenous cultures for their own gain. Throughout history, artists have borrowed from other cultures to create new works of art, but the problem arises when they do so without acknowledging or respecting the source culture. This can result in the misrepresentation of the original culture, the erasure of its history, and the exploitation of its people.

One of the most significant examples of cultural appropriation in the arts is the use of Native American symbols and imagery by non-Native American creators. For instance, the use of Native American headdresses by non-Native American pop stars and fashion designers has been widely criticized for its disrespectful and exploitative nature. The appropriation of Native American culture has been linked to the erasure of the Native American experience and the promotion of stereotypes.

Similarly, the use of African-American culture in music and fashion has been a subject of controversy. The appropriation of African-American culture by white artists and designers has been linked to the erasure of African-American history and the promotion of racial stereotypes. This is particularly problematic when it comes to the use of African-American vernacular English and slang by white artists, which has been criticized for its cultural appropriation and lack of authenticity.

The impact of cultural appropriation in the arts is significant. It can lead to the erasure of the original culture, the promotion of stereotypes, and the exploitation of marginalized communities. It also perpetuates the idea that certain cultures are inferior to others, which can lead to discrimination and racism. Cultural appropriation in the arts also has a financial impact, as it can lead to the exploitation of marginalized communities for the financial gain of non-members of the culture.

In conclusion, cultural appropriation in the arts is a complex and controversial issue that requires careful consideration and respect for the source culture. It is essential to acknowledge and respect the original culture when borrowing from it, to avoid the misrepresentation, exploitation, and erasure of the original culture. By doing so, we can create a more inclusive and respectful society, where all cultures are valued and celebrated. ",Mixtral-8x7B,1,"

55,"The Ethics of Animal Rights in Scientific Research

Scientific research has been essential in advancing our understanding of the world around us and in developing new technologies and medical treatments. However, the use of animals in scientific research has been a topic of ethical debate for many years. On one hand, some argue that using animals in research is necessary for human advancement and the betterment of society. On the other hand, there are those who believe that animals have inherent rights and should not be used for human benefit. This paper will explore the ethical considerations surrounding animal rights in scientific research and examine the arguments for and against the use of animals in this context.

One of the main arguments in favor of using animals in scientific research is the potential benefits to human health and well-being. Many medical breakthroughs and treatments have been developed through research involving animals, such as the development of vaccines, surgical techniques, and the understanding of disease processes. Without the use of animals in research, it would be much more difficult to make progress in understanding and treating human diseases. Additionally, animals are often used in testing the safety of new drugs and medical procedures before they are used in humans, which helps to ensure the safety and efficacy of these treatments.

Another argument in support of using animals in scientific research is that it is necessary for the advancement of scientific knowledge. By studying animals, researchers can gain insights into biological processes, behavior, and genetics that can be applied to a wide range of scientific fields. This knowledge can lead to new discoveries and innovations that benefit both humans and animals. For example, research on animal behavior has led to improvements in animal welfare and conservation efforts, as well as a better understanding of human behavior and psychology.

However, despite these potential benefits, there are also ethical concerns surrounding the use of animals in scientific research. One of the main issues is the suffering and harm experienced by animals involved in research. Many animals are subjected to procedures that cause pain, distress, and suffering, such as surgical procedures, confinement in small cages, and exposure to harmful substances. This raises questions about the ethical treatment of animals and the extent to which their suffering can be justified for the potential benefits to humans.

Furthermore, there is a concern about the moral status of animals and whether they have inherent rights that should be respected. Some argue that animals have the capacity to experience pain, pleasure, and emotions, and therefore have a moral status that should be considered in ethical decision-making. This raises questions about the use of animals as mere means to human ends, and whether there are alternative methods of research that could be used to minimize harm to animals.

In response to these ethical concerns, there have been efforts to regulate the use of animals in scientific research and to promote the welfare of research animals. Many countries have laws and regulations in place to ensure that animals used in research are treated humanely and that their suffering is minimized. Additionally, there has been a growing emphasis on the use of alternatives to animal research, such as computer modeling, cell cultures, and non-invasive imaging techniques, which can reduce the need for animal experimentation.

In conclusion, the ethics of animal rights in scientific research is a complex and contentious issue that raises important questions about the moral status of animals and the ethical treatment of research subjects. While there are potential benefits to using animals in research, there are also ethical concerns about the suffering and harm experienced by animals, as well as the moral status of animals and their rights. It is important for researchers, policymakers, and society as a whole to carefully consider these ethical considerations and to strive for a balance between advancing scientific knowledge and promoting the welfare of animals. By doing so, we can work towards a more ethical and compassionate approach to scientific research that respects the rights and well-being of all living beings.",GPT-3.5,1,"The Ethics of Animal Rights in Scientific Research

Some people argue that they should continue to operate, while others believe they should be closed down. In my opinion, zoos should remain open because they play an important role in conservation and education.

Firstly, zoos are important for conservation. They provide a safe environment for endangered species to live and breed. For example, the black-footed ferret was once thought to be extinct in the wild, but thanks to breeding programs in zoos, they have been successfully reintroduced into their natural habitat. Zoos also educate visitors about the importance of conservation and the threats that animals face in the wild.

Secondly, zoos provide an opportunity for education. They allow people to see and learn about animals that they may never have the chance to see in the wild. Zoos often have exhibits that teach visitors about the animalâs natural habitat and behavior. For example, at my local zoo, there is a rainforest exhibit that shows the different layers of the rainforest and the animals that live there. This kind of education is not possible in a classroom setting.

While some argue that zoos are unethical and cruel, most modern zoos prioritize the well-being of their animals. They provide spacious enclosures and enrichment activities to keep the animals mentally and physically stimulated. Additionally, many zoos participate in conservation efforts and release programs, which help endangered species return to the wild.

In conclusion, zoos play an important role in conservation and education. They provide a safe environment for endangered species and educate visitors about the importance of conservation. While there are arguments against zoos, most modern zoos prioritize the well-being of their animals and participate in conservation efforts.

Hip-hop culture has been a dominant force in popular media for over three decades now, influencing everything from film to television to art and even politics. However, one aspect of hip-hop that often goes unnoticed is its impact on fashion. Hip-hop style has become a staple of modern fashion, with many designers incorporating elements of streetwear into their collections and mainstream brands collaborating with hip-hop artists on clothing lines. In this essay, we will explore how hip-hop music and fashion have influenced each other and what the future holds for these two intertwined industries.

Evolution of Hip-Hop Fashion:

Hip-hop fashion originated in the streets of New York City in the 1970s and 80s, where young African American and Latino youth used clothing as a form of self-expression and identity formation. Early hip-hop fashion was characterized by oversized t-shirts, baggy jeans, and sneakers, which were often customized with graffiti art and logos. As hip-hop music gained popularity, so did its associated fashion trends, spreading from urban centers to suburban areas across America.

One of the most iconic figures in early hip-hop fashion was Grandmaster Flash, who wore black leather jackets adorned with gold chains and flashy accessories. Another influential figure was Run-DMC, known for his Adidas Superstar sneakers, which became a staple of hip-hop fashion. These early fashion choices reflected the resourcefulness and creativity of hip-hop culture, using everyday items and repurposing them for personal expression.

As hip-hop continued to evolve, so did its fashion. In the late 1990s and early 2000s, hip-hop fashion began to take cues from luxury fashion brands, with rappers such as Sean Combs and Jay-Z sporting designer clothes and accessories. This shift towards high-end fashion marked a turning point in the relationship between hip-hop and fashion, as mainstream brands began taking notice of the influence of hip-hop culture on consumer behavior.

Influence of Hip-Hop Music on Fashion:

Hip-hop music has played an undeniable role in shaping fashion trends, not only through the styles worn by artists but also through the lyrics they use. Many rap songs celebrate materialism and the acquisition of status symbols, such as expensive cars, jewelry, and designer clothing. These lyrics send a message to listeners about what is desirable and aspirational, influencing their purchasing decisions and fashion choices.

Moreover, hip-hop music has provided a platform for marginalized communities to express themselves and challenge societal norms. Through their music and fashion, hip-hop artists have promoted body positivity, gender fluidity, and racial pride, inspiring fans to embrace their individuality and reject traditional beauty standards.

Collaborations and Crossover Appeal:

62,"The water cycle is a fundamental process that regulates the movement of water throughout the Earth's system. It plays a crucial role in shaping the Earth's weather patterns and climate. The water cycle, also known as the hydrological cycle, involves the continuous movement of water between the Earth's surface, the atmosphere, and the oceans. This complex and dynamic process consists of several key stages, including evaporation, condensation, precipitation, and runoff.

Evaporation is the first stage of the water cycle, in which water from the Earth's surface, such as oceans, lakes, and rivers, is heated by the sun and transformed into water vapor. This water vapor then rises into the atmosphere, where it undergoes the process of condensation. During condensation, the water vapor cools and forms tiny water droplets, which gather to create clouds. These clouds play a crucial role in the water cycle, as they are responsible for the formation of precipitation.

Precipitation is the next stage of the water cycle, where the water droplets in the clouds combine and grow in size until they become heavy enough to fall to the Earth's surface as rain, snow, sleet, or hail. Once the precipitation reaches the Earth, it can take several different paths. Some of the water may be absorbed by the soil and used by plants, while the rest may flow into rivers, lakes, or oceans as runoff.

Runoff is a significant component of the water cycle, as it allows water to return to the Earth's oceans and complete the cycle. The water that flows into rivers and streams eventually makes its way back to the oceans, where it can once again evaporate and begin the cycle anew. This continuous movement of water is essential for maintaining the Earth's water supply and regulating the planet's climate.

The water cycle has a profound impact on the Earth's weather patterns. The distribution of water across the planet influences the temperature, humidity, and pressure of the atmosphere, which in turn affects weather phenomena such as clouds, precipitation, and storms. For example, the evaporation of water from the Earth's surface provides a source of moisture for the atmosphere, which can lead to the formation of clouds and the occurrence of precipitation. This process plays a critical role in determining the amount and timing of rainfall in different regions, influencing the growth of crops, the availability of freshwater, and the occurrence of natural disasters such as floods and droughts.

Furthermore, the water cycle plays a crucial role in regulating the Earth's temperature. The process of evaporation requires energy from the sun, which heats the Earth's surface and the atmosphere. As water vapor rises into the atmosphere, it releases this heat energy, contributing to the warming of the air. This process helps to regulate the Earth's temperature and maintain a stable climate. Additionally, the movement of water across the Earth's surface can also influence the distribution of heat, leading to the formation of ocean currents and affecting regional climates.

In conclusion, the water cycle is a vital process that shapes the Earth's weather patterns and climate. Its continuous movement of water between the Earth's surface, atmosphere, and oceans plays a crucial role in regulating the distribution of moisture and heat across the planet. Understanding the water cycle is essential for predicting weather patterns, managing water resources, and addressing the impacts of climate change. By studying this fundamental process, scientists can gain valuable insights into the Earth's complex and interconnected systems, leading to a better understanding of the planet's weather and climate.",GPT-3.5,1,"The water cycle is a fundamental process that regulates the movement of water throughout the Earth's system. It plays a crucial role in shaping the Earth's weather patterns and climate. The water cycle, also known as the hydrological cycle, involves the continuous movement of water between the Earth's surface, the atmosphere, and the oceans. This complex and dynamic process consists of several key stages, including evaporation, condensation, precipitation, and runoff.

Evaporation is the first stage of the water cycle, in which water from the Earth's surface, such as oceans, lakes, and rivers, is heated by the sun and transformed into water vapor. This water vapor then rises into the atmosphere, where it undergoes the process of condensation. During condensation, the water vapor cools and forms tiny water droplets, which gather to create clouds. These clouds play a crucial role in the water cycle, as they are responsible for the formation of precipitation.

Precipitation is the next stage of the water cycle, where the water droplets in the clouds combine and grow in size until they become heavy enough to fall to the Earth's surface as rain, snow, sleet, or hail. Once the precipitat",0.6533203125,1

67,"The Facial Action Coding System (FACS) is a groundbreaking technology that enables computers to recognize and interpret human emotions. While this technology has the potential to revolutionize various fields, its application in educational settings remains a topic of debate. In this essay, I will discuss the pros and cons of adopting FACS to evaluate students' emotional expressions in the classroom, as detailed in the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile.""

One of the primary advantages of using FACS in the classroom is that it can help teachers better understand their students' emotional states. By detecting facial expressions, computers equipped with FACS can alert teachers to students who may be confused, bored, or distressed, allowing them to adjust their teaching methods accordingly. This can lead to a more personalized learning experience for students, as teachers can tailor their instruction to meet the individual needs of each student. Additionally, FACS can help teachers identify students who may be struggling with a particular concept or subject, enabling them to provide extra support and guidance.

Another benefit of FACS is that it can help create a more supportive and inclusive learning environment. By recognizing and addressing students' emotional needs, teachers can foster a sense of belonging and community in the classroom. This can be particularly beneficial for students who may feel marginalized or isolated, as it can help them feel seen and heard. Furthermore, FACS can help teachers identify students who may be experiencing emotional difficulties outside of the classroom, such as bullying or family problems, allowing them to provide appropriate support and resources.

Despite these potential benefits, there are also several drawbacks to adopting FACS in the classroom. One of the main concerns is the invasion of privacy that this technology poses. By monitoring students' facial expressions, FACS could potentially infringe on their right to privacy and personal space. This could lead to students feeling uncomfortable or anxious, which could negatively impact their learning experience. Moreover, the use of FACS could perpetuate harmful stereotypes and biases, as computers may be programmed to recognize certain emotions as being more ""appropriate"" or ""desirable"" than others.

Another disadvantage of FACS is its potential to disrupt the learning process. By constantly monitoring students' emotions, computers may interrupt the natural flow of instruction, causing distractions and confusion. Additionally, the use of FACS could create a culture of surveillance in the classroom, where students feel like they are being constantly watched and judged. This could lead to a negative and stressful learning environment, which could ultimately hinder students' academic performance.

Furthermore, the implementation of FACS in the classroom is not without its practical challenges. For instance, equipping each student with a computer equipped with FACS would be a significant financial investment, which may not be feasible for many schools. Moreover, the technology itself may not be foolproof, as it may struggle to accurately detect emotions in students with diverse facial features or expressions.

In conclusion, while the use of FACS in the classroom has its potential benefits, such as providing teachers with valuable insights into students' emotional states, it also poses significant privacy concerns and practical challenges. Instead of relying on technology to evaluate students' emotions, it is important to prioritize human-centric teaching methods that value empathy, connection, and understanding. By fostering a supportive and inclusive learning environment, teachers can create a space where students feel comfortable expressing their emotions and needs, without the need for invasive technology. Ultimately, the use of FACS in the classroom should be approached with caution and respect for students' privacy and individuality.",LLaMA-2-70B,1,"The Facial Action Coding System (FACS) is a groundbreaking technology that enables computers to recognize and interpret human emotions.

76,"""Driverless Cars are Coming: Navigating the Road to the Future"" is an article that presents the pros and cons of the adoption of autonomous vehicles. The article raises several critical questions about the safety, dependency on technology, socio-economic implications, legal and ethical issues, and the need for caution in the adoption of self-driving cars. While the article provides a balanced view of the issue, I believe that the benefits of driverless cars outweigh the risks.

One of the primary concerns raised by the article is the safety of autonomous vehicles. The author argues that traditional cars, designed for human control, embody a sense of direct responsibility, and the introduction of automated vehicles shifts this paradigm, raising concerns about reliance on sensors and algorithms. However, I believe that the safety of driverless vehicles is not a concern. According to a report by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, 94% of all car accidents are caused by human error. In contrast, self-driving cars rely on advanced sensors and algorithms that can detect potential hazards and react faster than human drivers. Therefore, autonomous vehicles are likely to reduce accidents and save lives.

Another concern raised by the article is the dependency on technology. The author argues that the progression towards automated vehicles is symptomatic of a broader societal trend, increasing dependency on technology. The convenience of having a car drive itself could exacerbate this issue, potentially leading to a disconnection from the act of driving and a lack of situational awareness. While I agree that technology dependency is a concern, I believe that the benefits of autonomous vehicles outweigh this risk. Self-driving cars will allow people to use their commuting time more efficiently, such as working, reading, or relaxing. Additionally, autonomous cars have the potential to reduce the number of cars on the road, leading to a decrease in traffic congestion and emissions.

The article also raises economic and accessibility concerns. The cost of developing and owning such advanced technology could create a divide, where only a select few can afford these vehicles. This exclusivity could lead to wider socio-economic disparities and question the practicality of mass-producing vehicles that are not universally accessible. I believe that these concerns are valid, but they are not a reason to abandon the adoption of autonomous vehicles. Instead, policymakers can take steps to ensure that autonomous vehicles are affordable and accessible to everyone. For example, governments can provide subsidies to automakers to produce affordable autonomous vehicles or invest in public transportation systems that incorporate autonomous vehicles.

The introduction of driverless cars also brings forth legal and ethical challenges. In the event of technology failure resulting in accidents, the lines of liability blur. Is the driver, who is no longer in active control, responsible, or does the onus fall on the manufacturer? This grey area could lead to complex legal battles and moral dilemmas. While I agree that these legal and ethical issues are important, I believe that they can be addressed through legislation and regulations. Policymakers can work with automakers to establish clear liability guidelines in the event of accidents caused by autonomous vehicles.

The author argues that the adoption of autonomous vehicles requires a balanced approach that weighs the benefits against the risks. While I agree with this statement, I believe that the benefits of driverless cars outweigh the risks. Autonomous vehicles have the potential to reduce accidents, traffic congestion, and emissions, while also improving the efficiency of commuting time. However, policymakers must address the economic and accessibility concerns and establish clear liability guidelines to ensure that the adoption of autonomous vehicles is equitable and safe for all.

In conclusion, the adoption of autonomous vehicles is a complex issue with pros and cons. While the article presents a balanced view of the issue, I believe that the benefits of driverless cars outweigh the risks. Autonomous vehicles have the potential to reduce accidents, traffic congestion, and emissions, while also improving the efficiency of commuting time.

80," In the digital era, celebrity, reputation, and privacy have all undergone a significant transformation. The rise of social media platforms such as Instagram, Twitter, and YouTube has made it easier for individuals to gain public attention and build their personal brand. However, this also means that celebrities are constantly under the scrutiny of their fans and the general public. The idea of privacy has become blurred as people share personal details about their lives online, and celebrities often feel compelled to maintain a certain level of visibility to stay relevant.

One of the most significant changes in celebrity culture is the democratization of fame. Anyone can become a celebrity these days, thanks to social media platforms that allow users to share their talents, ideas, and personal lives with the world. This has led to the rise of ""influencers,"" individuals who have built massive followings on social media and can influence the purchasing decisions of their fans. While this may seem like a positive development, it has also led to a culture of ""fake it till you make it,"" where people try to cultivate an image of success and glamour online, even if they don't necessarily have it in real life.

Reputation has also become more important than ever in the digital age. With the power of the internet, a single negative comment or rumor can spread like wildfire, damaging an individual's reputation beyond repair. Celebrities, in particular, are vulnerable to this kind of backlash, as they often have a large number of critics who are quick to condemn them for everything from their personal lives to their professional choices. To maintain their reputation, celebrities must constantly monitor their online presence and respond to negative comments or accusations quickly and effectively.

However, this focus on reputation can also lead to a culture of over-sensitivity and censorship. Celebrities may feel pressured to avoid controversy or to delete posts that could potentially harm their image. This can result in a lack of authenticity and transparency, as people may begin to question whether the person they're following online is the same person they see in real life.

Finally, the concept of privacy has become increasingly complex in the digital era. Celebrities, in particular, struggle to maintain a sense of privacy in the face of constant media scrutiny and fan interest. While some celebrities embrace their fame and openness, others try to maintain a certain level of anonymity or control over their personal lives. This can lead to tensions between celebrities and the media, as well as between celebrities and their fans.

In conclusion, the changing nature of celebrity, reputation, and privacy in the digital era has led to both opportunities and challenges. While social media platforms have made it easier for individuals to gain fame and influence, they have also made it harder to maintain a sense of authenticity and privacy.

82,"From time immemorial, myths have woven the very fabric of cultural identity, serving as the underpinnings of societies and as the loom upon which the threads of human experience are intricately interlaced. These stories, these grand narratives of gods and monsters, heroes and villains, creation and destruction, are not mere fanciful tales to entertain a fireside audience. They are the repositories of communal values, collective psychology, and the scaffolding of social norms that have guided civilizations across the aeons.

The role of myth in shaping cultural identity is multifaceted, as myths serve to encode the collective wisdom and experience of a people. They are the compass by which a society navigates the tumultuous seas of existence, providing bearings to those who seek to understand their place in the cosmos. Myths give a sense of origin, offering an explanation for how things came to be. This sense of a shared past creates a continuum, a narrative thread that links ancestors with the current generation, and passes on to the progeny. In doing so, myths become the timeless gatekeepers of tradition, ensuring that the cultural heritage is preserved and perpetuated.

Consider the mythologies of ancient Greece. Characters such as Zeus, Hercules, and Athena are not merely characters in a pantheon of deities to be worshipped. They embody the virtues and vices of humanity, acting as mirrors in which the Greeks could see the best and worst of themselves reflected. The myths surrounding these figures taught the values of courage, wisdom, strength, and temperance. They functioned as the moral compasses for Greek society, offering tales of caution, aspiration, and reflection. The stories of their gods and heroes became the keystones of their cultural identity, influencing everything from their politics and philosophy to their art and architecture.

Similarly, in the Norse cultures, the sagas of Odin, Thor, and Loki, and the epic narrative of RagnarÃ¶k, the twilight of the gods, offered not only a creation myth but also a prophetic vision of the world's end. These myths provided a framework for understanding the cyclical nature of life and death, and instilled values of bravery and honor. The Norse people found meaning in these stories, shaping their worldview and influencing their actions. The myths became part of the Viking identity, evident in their seafaring expeditions and quest for glory.

Across the ocean, the rich tapestry of Native American mythology presents yet another example of how myths shape cultural identity. The stories of creation, often involving animal spirits and the harmonious relationship between man and nature, encapsulate the deep respect for the environment that is a hallmark of many Native American cultures. These stories are not only a means of cultural expression but also a guide for living in balance with the world. They inform practices of stewardship and sustainability, and reinforce the interconnectedness of all living things, which is central to the identity of many tribes.

Moreover, myths have the power to unite people under a common banner, creating a sense of belonging and community. During times of strife or challenge, myths can be a source of strength and resilience. They remind individuals that they are part of a larger story, one filled with heroes who have overcome great obstacles. This collective narrative becomes a source of pride and solidarity, binding the members of a culture together in shared heritage and destiny.

Myths also serve to demarcate the boundaries of cultural identity. By establishing what is sacred and profane, what is heroic and what is cowardly, myths create an in-group and an out-group, drawing lines between ""us"" and ""them."" This delineation can be seen in the classic dichotomy of the Greek city-states Athens and Sparta, each with their own mythic traditions and heroic ideals that defined their respective societies and set them apart from each other as well as from their enemies.

The role of myth in shaping cultural identity extends into the modern era. Although the ancient gods may no longer hold sway over the beliefs of the majority, the mythic structures remain ingrained in our collective psyches. The rise of nationalism in the 19th and 20th centuries, for instance, saw the resurgence of mythic narratives that sought to unify disparate groups under a single national identity, often rekindling ancient legends or creating new myths to inspire patriotism and a sense of common destiny.

In contemporary culture, myths continue to evolve and find new expressions.

87,"The Irish playwright Samuel Beckett is known for his existentialist dramas that explore the absurdity of life. His plays often feature characters who are trapped in meaningless situations, struggling to find purpose and existential fulfillment. Beckett's works are filled with themes of futility, despair, and the inherent absurdity of existence. In this essay, we will examine how Beckett portrays existential dread and the absurd in his plays Waiting for Godot, Endgame, and Krapp's Last Tape.

Waiting for Godot, Beckett's most famous play, premiered in 1953. The play revolves around two characters, Vladimir and Estragon, who are waiting for a mysterious character named Godot. Despite their best efforts, Godot never arrives, leaving the two characters in a state of perpetual anticipation and frustration. Throughout the play, Vladimir and Estragon engage in meaningless conversations and activities, struggling to pass the time and find a reason for their existence. The play's existential core is encapsulated in the famous line ""We are all in the same boat, without a rudder, without a compass, adrift on the open sea, the waves of which are continually growing higher and higher, until they engulf us."" This line captures the existential despair and absurdity of life, as the characters are left adrift without purpose or direction.

Beckett's play Endgame, written in 1957, explores similar themes of existential dread and meaninglessness. The play takes place in a bleak, post-apocalyptic world where four characters are trapped in a single room. Hamm, a paraplegic, is confined to a chair, while his mother, Nell, is confined to a wastebin. Their caretaker, Clov, is also trapped in the room, unable to leave. Despite their dire circumstances, the characters engage in tedious and pointless activities, such as shifting positions and playing games. The play's absurdity is exemplified by the exchange between Hamm and Clov, wherein they count the number of times they have exchanged greetings: ""One hundred and seventy-seven times."" ""One more time then."" ""Good morning, Clov."" ""Good morning, sir."" This absurd exchange highlights the futility of human existence, as the characters are trapped in a cycle of meaningless repetition.

Krapp's Last Tape, written in 1969, features a character named Krapp who is listening to old tape recordings of himself. The play takes place over the course of one night, as Krapp replays various tapes from different stages of his life. Throughout the play, Krapp reflects on his past actions and decisions, grappling with the feeling that his life has been meaningless and devoid of purpose. In one particularly poignant moment, Krapp says, ""What a fine mess I've made of things. And it's all of my own making too, every little bit of it."" This line encapsulates the existential dread and self-blame that often accompanies the realization that one's life has been spent chasing meaningless goals and pursuits.

In conclusion, Samuel Beckett's plays are rich in themes of existential dread and the absurd. His characters are trapped in meaningless situations, struggling to find purpose and fulfillment in a world that seems devoid of meaning. Through his characters' existential angst and absurd behaviors, Beckett challenges the audience to question their own beliefs about the nature of existence and the meaning of life.",Noromaid-20B,1,"The Irish playwright Samuel Beckett is known for his existentialist dramas that explore the absurdity of life.

88,"The debate around free will versus determinism has been a topic of philosophical, scientific, and ethical discussion for centuries. At the heart of this debate is the question of whether human beings have the ability to make choices and decisions freely, or if their actions are predetermined by factors such as genetics, environment, and past experiences. This age-old debate has profound implications for our understanding of human agency, moral responsibility, and the nature of reality itself.

On one side of the debate, proponents of free will argue that individuals have the capacity to make choices that are not determined by external forces. They believe that human beings possess a unique ability to exercise agency and autonomy, and that our actions are the result of conscious deliberation and personal volition. According to this view, individuals are responsible for their choices and actions, and are capable of shaping their own destinies through the exercise of free will.

On the other hand, proponents of determinism argue that human behavior is governed by a complex web of causes and effects, and that our actions are ultimately determined by factors beyond our control. This perspective posits that the laws of nature, genetics, social conditioning, and environmental influences all play a role in shaping human behavior, and that free will is an illusion. According to determinists, every choice we make is the inevitable result of prior causes, and our sense of agency is merely a product of our limited understanding of the underlying determinants of our actions.

The debate between free will and determinism is not merely an abstract philosophical exercise, but has important implications for fields such as ethics, law, psychology, and theology. For example, the question of moral responsibility hinges on whether individuals can be held accountable for their actions if they are ultimately determined by external factors. If determinism is true, then the concept of moral responsibility becomes problematic, as it suggests that individuals are not truly in control of their actions and therefore cannot be held morally culpable for them.

Moreover, the debate has also sparked scientific inquiry into the nature of consciousness, decision-making, and the brain. Advances in neuroscience have raised questions about the extent to which our choices are influenced by neural processes and biological factors, leading some to argue that our sense of free will may be an illusion created by the brain. This has led to a convergence of philosophical and scientific perspectives on the question of free will, as researchers seek to understand the relationship between the mind, the brain, and the nature of human agency.

In addition, the debate around free will versus determinism has profound implications for our understanding of the nature of reality and the universe. If determinism is true, it suggests that the entire course of the universe, from the movement of celestial bodies to the actions of individuals, is governed by a fixed set of laws and initial conditions. This raises questions about the nature of human freedom, the existence of alternative possibilities, and the ultimate purpose or meaning of human existence in a deterministic universe.

Despite the deep-seated nature of this debate, it is important to recognize that the dichotomy between free will and determinism may not be as clear-cut as it seems. Some philosophers have proposed alternative perspectives that seek to reconcile these seemingly contradictory positions. For example, compatibilists argue that free will and determinism are not mutually exclusive, and that it is possible for individuals to make free choices within a deterministic framework. According to this view, free will is not incompatible with the idea that our actions are shaped by external factors, and that our ability to make choices is not necessarily undermined by the existence of causal determinants.

In conclusion, the debate around free will versus determinism is a complex and multifaceted issue that has far-reaching implications for our understanding of human nature, morality, and the nature of reality. While the debate may never be fully resolved, it continues to inspire profound philosophical inquiry, scientific research, and ethical reflection. Whether one ultimately believes in the existence of free will, the inexorable forces of determinism, or some combination of the two, the debate challenges us to grapple with fundamental questions about the nature of human agency and the mysteries of existence.",GPT-3.5,1,"The debate around free will versus determinism has been a topic of philosophical, scientific, and ethical discussion for centuries.

96,"The atomic bomb, which is a weapon of mass destruction, has a very short yet complicated history. It was developed during World War II as a result of the Manhattan Project, which was a top-secret military and scientific project that was started in 1942. The project was created to develop the first nuclear weapons, and its aim was to bring the war to an end as quickly as possible. The atomic bomb was first tested on July 16, 1945, in New Mexico, and it was used for the first time on August 6, 1945, in Hiroshima, Japan. The bomb caused massive destruction, and it killed over 140,000 people instantly. Three days later, another atomic bomb was dropped on Nagasaki, and it killed over 70,000 people. The use of the atomic bomb was a turning point in human history, and it has had a huge impact on the world.
The development of the atomic bomb began in the early 1930s when several scientists started to work on the theory of nuclear fission. Nuclear fission is a process in which the nucleus of an atom is split into two smaller nuclei, which release a large amount of energy. The scientists involved in this research included Albert Einstein, Enrico Fermi, and Leo Szilard. They believed that if they could harness the power of nuclear fission, they could create a weapon that would be more powerful than any other weapon that had ever been created.
In 1942, the United States government decided to start the Manhattan Project, which was a top-secret military and scientific project that was designed to develop the first nuclear weapons. The project was led by physicist Dr. J. Robert Oppenheimer, and it brought together some of the most brilliant scientists and engineers in the world. They worked on the project at several different sites, including Los Alamos, New Mexico, and Oak Ridge, Tennessee.
The scientists involved in the Manhattan Project had to work very hard to develop the atomic bomb. They had to figure out how to create the necessary materials, and they had to develop the bomb's design. They also had to work on the bomb's delivery system, which included the development of the first atomic bombs.
On July 16, 1945, the atomic bomb was tested for the first time in New Mexico. The test was a success, and the scientists were able to confirm that the bomb was workable. A few weeks later, on August 6, 1945, the first atomic bomb was used in Hiroshima, Japan. The bomb was dropped from a plane, and it created a huge explosion that destroyed everything within a mile of the blast. The bomb caused massive destruction, and it killed over 140,000 people instantly. Three days later, another atomic bomb was dropped on Nagasaki, and it killed over 70,000 people.
The use of the atomic bomb was a turning point in human history. It was the first time that a weapon of mass destruction had been used, and it showed that humanity had the power to destroy itself. The bomb also led to the start of the Cold War, which was a period of intense competition between the United States and the Soviet Union. The two countries developed their own nuclear weapons, and they used them as a way to threaten each other.
In conclusion, the development of the atomic bomb was a very complex and challenging project. It was a huge achievement for science and technology, but it also had a very negative impact on the world. The bomb has been used twice in history, and it has caused massive destruction and loss of life. It is hoped that the bomb will never be used again, and that humanity will find a way to live in peace and harmony.",Nous-Hermes-LLaMA-2-13B,1,"The atomic bomb, which is a weapon of mass destruction, has a very short yet complicated history.

97,"The role of citizen journalism in the information age is an indispensable aspect of modern society. As technology continues to advance at an unprecedented rate, traditional forms of journalism are being challenged and supplemented by the rise of citizen journalism. This phenomenon refers to the active participation of ordinary individuals in the collection, reporting, and dissemination of news and information. In an era where anyone with a smartphone and internet access can become a journalist, citizen journalism has become a vital source of information, offering diverse perspectives and uncovering stories that may otherwise go unnoticed.

One of the key advantages of citizen journalism lies in its ability to democratize the media landscape. In the past, traditional news outlets held a monopoly over the flow of information, deciding what stories were deemed newsworthy and controlling the narrative. Citizen journalism disrupts this power dynamic by allowing anyone with a device and internet connection to share their experiences and perspectives. This democratization of media empowers marginalized communities and gives a voice to those who have historically been silenced or underrepresented in the mainstream media.

Furthermore, citizen journalism has the potential to provide a more comprehensive and nuanced understanding of events. Traditional news outlets often operate within certain constraints, such as limited resources and editorial biases. Citizen journalists, on the other hand, are not bound by these limitations and can offer alternative viewpoints that may challenge the dominant narrative. This diversity of perspectives fosters a more informed and critical public discourse, enabling individuals to make well-rounded judgments and decisions.

Additionally, citizen journalism plays a crucial role in holding those in power accountable. With the rise of social media platforms, information can spread rapidly, reaching a wide audience in a matter of seconds. This has proven to be a powerful tool for citizen journalists, who can expose corruption, wrongdoing, and human rights abuses that may otherwise remain hidden. The ability of citizen journalists to document events in real-time and share them with the world has led to significant social and political change, as witnessed during the Arab Spring uprisings and the Black Lives Matter movement.

However, it is important to acknowledge the challenges and limitations of citizen journalism. Unlike professional journalists who undergo training and adhere to ethical guidelines, citizen journalists may lack the necessary skills and knowledge to report objectively. This can lead to the spread of misinformation and the propagation of biased viewpoints. Consequently, it becomes crucial for consumers of news to critically evaluate sources and cross-reference",GPT-3.5,1,"The role of citizen journalism in the information age is an indispensable aspect of modern society.

The idea that legislation can control human behavior is a topic that has been debated for centuries. Some argue that laws can be effective in shaping human behavior, while others contend that laws cannot change what is in people's hearts and minds. This paper aims to explore this topic in greater detail and provide specific reasons and examples to support the argument that laws cannot reform human nature.

To begin with, human nature is a complex and multi-faceted construct that encompasses a wide range of emotions, desires, and motivations. It is influenced by a multitude of factors, including genetics, upbringing, social environment, and personal experiences. Given this complexity, it is difficult to imagine how legislation could effectively reform human nature.

Furthermore, laws are often created in response to specific social problems or issues, and they can be effective in reducing or eliminating certain behaviors that are deemed detrimental to society. For example, laws prohibiting theft or violence can help reduce the occurrence of these crimes, but they cannot eliminate the underlying motivations or desires that drive people to engage in such behavior.

Moreover, laws are often enforced through punishment, such as fines, imprisonment, or even the death penalty. While these punishments can act as a deterrent, they cannot change a person's heart or mind. In fact, they may even serve to reinforce negative behaviors or create resentment and hostility towards authority figures.

Additionally, laws may not be effective in addressing all forms of human behavior. For example, laws that prohibit certain behaviors may be difficult to enforce, especially when they conflict with cultural norms or personal values. In such cases, individuals may continue to engage in the prohibited behavior despite the potential consequences.

Furthermore, human nature is constantly evolving, and laws are often slow to adapt to these changes. For example, laws that were once effective in controlling certain behaviors may become obsolete in the face of new technologies or social norms. This can lead to a disconnect between the law and the behavior it seeks to regulate, and may result in laws that are no longer effective in controlling or limiting human behavior.

In conclusion, while laws can be effective in controlling or placing limits on certain behaviors, they cannot reform human nature. Human behavior is influenced by a multitude of factors, and laws are often limited in their ability to address all aspects of this complexity. Moreover, laws may not be effective in addressing all forms of human behavior, and they may even serve to reinforce negative behaviors or create resentment towards authority figures. Ultimately, it is up to individuals to take responsibility for their own behavior and make changes in their lives, rather than relying on legislation to do so.",OpenHermes-2.5-Mistral-7B,1,"
